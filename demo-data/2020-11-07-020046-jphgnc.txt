massive sort almost users going affected implement users going impacted often premium users implement want support game support comment need add ads banner ads opt ads pop ads add cent charge getting rid ads including first two work add stamina bar ads watch refill instead paying dragon way expensive running griffin would making money ads well comment know weird could use ads far annoying certainly comment say kind stuff comment comment could implement space advertisers may want know people using dungeon subreddit would certainly get impression comment devs need profit comment yes much better ads ads ads pop ads opt ads banner ads also add cent charge get rid adds comment would certainly need able restrict certain ads comment almost users going affected implement users going affected draining money dungeon premium users comment agree feel devs want game full ads sure using comment ads stamina bars less annoying stamina bar think would especially drop dragon comment rough part difference draining free user premium user might paying enough great enough paying premium paying premium usage premium users many sure would pretty pay even dollars month know sense may either might even paying way comment per someone explain stamina bar comments get rough idea would like explanation comment dragon good comment pay game get comment better griffin normal sometimes like griffin people pay subscription dragon better griffin comment stamina tab comment pay dragon features paying access paying access dragon hell might even play griffin option difference comment understand would still pay could play certain amount energy bar comment forgot amino comment wow text look comment update almost every action stamina think drain stamina stamina wait bar refill hour long comment seen stamina bar see comment know bad chan mad comment think coming like two weeks comment really play dungeon much comment deleted comment comment comment darkness came lasermasters power back darkness many ages much time lasermasters darkness one hope keep latitude away dungeon last lasermaster comment like even much would others bad costs much run never see day rather banner ads comment yes would know usage rate session likely current energy bar outputs implemented well looks like one refill every minutes energy bar amount current system usage particular smaller energy bar time could opinion paying said understand users impacted understand need slow right fuck lot server comment comment experience dragon story sounds like human human human least energy system going pain see though would support watch add actions though comment correct bit undo redo apparently uses stamina get two free retries per input using stamina retry comment refill would pretty much fix whole thing comment heh heh got man raises sword stamina man stamina stamina space bar stamina comment sword raised stamina comment also forgot dungeon board comment feels like comment someone chan lmao lot shit still get lot dumb shit seen days ago character confirmed trans comment got know mobile games like let play certain amount force wait pay premium keep going exactly less comment wow rough considering game content think time back dungeon clover edition comment yes comment man raises sword stamina generate story man sword raised stamina bit wait minutes stamina pay stamina please wait costs way post times comment micro transactions could fine like cosmetic mtx could really nice way side without many people comment guys remember like stamina meter still premium use think mistake devs one feature everyone gets comment devs stamina bar actions per hours unless pay mtx course looks like applies free users griffin premium users dragon comment really pay actions comment unless price dollars month probably gonna drop gpt comment deleted comment real call people comment yeah considering user costs like feasible financially horrible way way absolutely massive want support dungeon getting enjoyment money pay let say month money pay enough enjoyment either unlimited much higher dragon access actions hours say comment adsense comment actually always mad something nothing new comment well kinda comment probably wait see actually opinion still nothing like dungeon pay support game comment impact see much getting money mtx amount traffic processing remember dragon comes sheer number tokens servers processing reduce amount tokens used servers reduce cost overall sure like exactly understand way amount processing costs comment fine ads enough premium users comment think way reduce amount work servers remember latitude gets flat number free tokens server farm use run dragon tokens used get every amount use total number actions player particular overall costs like way implemented kind understand want amount actions comment cosmetic mtx text based game comment course two weeks plan change users know comment post sub pretty high page page like page stuff comment problem app devs curating ads advertisers curating run controversial stuff gets absolutely advertisers pay way aidungeon end controversial comment sometimes extreme content goes like hosts including adsense must take enough hosts aid never ads really long time comment problem extreme oai still paying month comment meter premium users really feels like feature know already giving money feel like much non premium users option premium buying buy good amount stamina price premium would choice expensive playing smaller actions really feel good paying something action comment seems bit weird system premium users high response per minutes would understand something like many free users whole minutes premium users seems bit much comment forgot post tab even tab back post like comment wait add something less comment away half day half day put micro transactions game comment get two free retries per undo redo use energy need sounds like retries referring giving response dumb sucks comment deleted comment sub due days fucking sucks honestly nice things comment please tell stamina bar thing never heard means comment everyone free premium users comment feedback given figure make fun financially sustainable work coming days see adjust energy system based feedback keep dungeon great experience please figure make comment considering paying dragon model still going restrict comment comment deleted comment pain paying give get dollars comment stamina bar comment hope able fix way financially comment problem actually devs put unlimited first place think possible given current make sort plan work least way continue business put people feel impossible standard even generous offer business would seen taking stuff away users comment exactly work responses without able thing comment guess gonna playing released everyone absolutely stamina anything moment comment traffic actions action minutes get griffin actions say bad cause temporary solution comment temporary solution comment impact also sort stamina bar resin hey resin one two means content game without resin tell like dungeon devs greedy comment pay bit less get dragon features making different subscription tiers would option cause people would pay dragon less people would pay full price premium comment problem output good enough energy system like fine always thing learns players using amount learns would slow well comment comment think people buy comment clover edition comment well fun time end premium membership guess also want support game energy system pay feel stories even premium membership rather pay nothing playing aidungeon comment problem premium users loss pay power users play far non premium users play gpt input costs problem cost free players actually premium users time comment something like add get free retrys per turn two retrys one turn count energy bar comment wait stamina bar comment hell even premium users way comment pay subscriptions would correct fact dragon expensive run compared griffin even free devs first place pay every action input subscription money barely griffin costs per action difference costs griffin dragon devs simply paying opinion energy bar much compared ads normal ones cheap expensive subscriptions comment problem seems premium users use dragon much much expensive per response griffin play much comment wait dungeon board comment minute still long almost anything return people paying make worse people paying getting much free users reasonable losing money people use much making comment would still comment fuck comment amount ones games comment one forks released pretty much dungeon gpt along need good gpu run properly available along forks comment understand responses without stamina bar anything redo count responses drain bar get response back every minutes play hour want responses per minute redo count responses total means stamina bar minutes goes seems like affected play hours without comment going app comment deleted comment horrible stamina bar rather dragon entirely simply play griffin hope income though paying bit rather stick flat comment would tbh comment first one adjust stamina loss amount tokens feel pretty see stamina return pretty much text get stamina comment based player input never comment reason comment dungeon comment make sense charge per input given running server cost subscription would make sense please people comment someone plays game probably never inputs usually least hours session still hate even affected still possible solution whatever might unless trying players whatever reason see kinda thing adds make money long run hope case force look like ads cosmetics would buy ads cosmetics supporting company stamina bars still think stamina system lot generous games players premium feel real difference seeing bar feels bad paying premium premium features guess subscription get shit way supporting comment know energy bars mobile games give actions need either wait hours pay keep playing free players either also applies premium users comment mistake side change fact output often weird even retry times make better ads comment blocked comment lol comment good thing stopped playing ages ago still good comment greedy losing lot money aid comment aid financially sustainable moment seems like feature must right comment seems like aid game like well comment seems someone expecting special treatment based identity perspective normal character redefined trans would seem like otherwise good character warped pander trans individuals special treatment identity course character trans impression change would still sort reaction continue people seeing minority representation minority representation less ham fisted comment chan aidungeon community know comment deleted comment due even talking first redefined always trans devs confirmed otherwise good character warped pander trans individuals basically saying different less good character character means representation ham fisted trans ham representation would something like rowling every character minority released give better comment bad using take comment saying perspective looked like character redefined trans since implications retcon warped someone implications reaction much like others rowling retcon course likely plays part talking representation specific case talking representation good representation like people lot bigoted minority representation media likely comments media bigoted said entirely game community trying explain even agree comment heard sheer game server running later comment explore tab comment comment explore tab comment could someone explain actually costly run server read somewhere internet surprise running actually super cheap servers basically constantly right make sense make seem like costs three million euros month run damn server case devs really hungry money since understand anything servers explanation professional would appreciated comment could someone explain actually costly run server read somewhere internet surprise running actually super cheap servers basically constantly right make sense make seem like costs three million euros month run damn server case devs really hungry money since understand anything servers explanation professional would appreciated comment heard still going lmao comment explore tab comment comes openai prices charge gpt api honestly get comment someone help figure last lasermaster comment griffin model uses cheap gpt gpt comment chan board comment lol comment taken away comment still even premium users getting stamina bar even though paying help support servers comment problem business wise bad taking offer reason latitude comment hey trying users business perspective cost latitude flat rate subscription people would actually pay could cost oai numbers pretty public api costs charge data costs numbers much higher oai public price rate comment yeah sort getting people taken unlimited offer expecting impossible standard business wise think latitude hope enough users would sub enough would stick griffin cost power users apparently though anything latitude company unpopular comment electricity costs comment think making money really cosmetic thing kinda seems usage make things feasible unpopular later choice comment take say buying running server cost especially many people use stuff running server game fine free already using game something like aidungeon buy server keep server running servers pretty bad data comment even feel like noticed dragon getting worse played cthulhu would call cthulhu games fucking stories instead making story comment really comment stopped playing back gpt came back long ago noticed specific times comment deleted comment electricity run server server especially servers generate also got costs paying servers expensive also server internet got money well guys run server farm openai case business want make profit comment comment understanding even able run server server openai prices comment openai aid plan openai inputs servers give back outputs aid basically middle man comment dragon better back first honestly subscription barely played reason seems comment think might new text honestly comment tiers would good idea comment premium griffin option comment need good gpu run properly good bit aid gpu think referring gpt comment deleted comment yes said comment comment blocked comment plan

mods mods patches game might want install installation colab file link github colab file mods installed simply run code cells hang detection model control user inference time using command custom prompt find annoying game adds custom prompt custom unrestricted mode think good name one command write directly story without automatic conversion action typing dragon flies dragon files default patch typing dragon flies directly story use print command check retry command adds command retry allows get different using action may run apply hang detection long says patch applied work fine characters allows switch different characters using setchar command example setchar old must write since automatic conversion would may run merge conflicts applying mods run merge conflict run git abort files previous state everything mods one without worry merge conflicts like install using colab must create copy google modify first need install mods make sure git repo downloaded using colab need change first line first code cell git clone depth branch master git clone branch master remove depth next copy code mods code cell create new code cells code must run running first cell time game apply run see line patch applied worked local installation game simply enter directory game installed bash shell paste code patches install excluding first line bash works colab jupyter patches installed local installation applied update version merge current branch new updates game high run sort merge conflict longer version tell git say patch applied please comment try fix soon possible downgrade version colab jupyter continue using mods add first code cell downgrade version mods edac cddfe change git clone branch master aidungeon install ipython display import clear_output clear_output print download complete git clone branch master aidungeon git checkout old modded version edac cddfe install ipython display import clear_output clear_output print download complete local installation simply run git checkout old modded version edac cddfe shell installation directory downgrade comment oops hang detection one working fix soon updating right may take please install comment comment game lot people comment okay two comment thanks install hang detection uncensored version game unrestricted mod worked fine comment know need uncensored version current version allows enter command comment amazing comment possible also fix model looping error since gpt seed multiple see example able keep seed works would essentially remove annoying comment seem like would work implementing working code self action block try block func_timeout self self generate self action functiontimedout print timed retrying time pass block block works hang model timed retrying seems like know gpt generate seed code directly inference model pass sort seed tell comment oops comment seems looping issue problem work patch comment okay implementing prevention issue trying hang prevention find happening random seed state model maybe story comment could comment seem install locally keep trying run script says fatal git directory comment directory change directories running path aidungeon downloaded aidungeon file github version information must download new installation using git version information run git clone directory want install create new folder aidungeon version information comment worked thanks comment think would cool mod could switch multiple different characters think mod would local multiplayer comment hang detection amazing long story dark dark tried old comment thank idea far looks like works check patch also installing mods without worry merge conflicts installing like comment sorry really much could add instructions tried simply using git clone google collab running patch fatal git directory fatal git directory fatal git directories git edit oops looks like adding aidungeon fixes comment comment interesting change change temperature temperature temperature best high temperature random may original maybe mod making patch version comment think would really cool google colab link essentially dungeon mods already installed comment awesome thank much adding amazing mods game comment really good ideas post thanks comment good ideas adding like custom prompt change since one patch seems install nice could get old custom prompt back like instead always edit another interesting idea adding another unrestricted mode text without text comment really github seems take comment getting error trying patch everything using git bash error corrupt patch line error could build fake ancestor downloaded repo using git clone patching dungeon master folder sure happening line making fail edit install custom prompt unrestricted mode stand hang detection stand seems issue game game seems say find import import line func_timeout import func_timeout functiontimedout comment thank stream using new mods awesome comment thank think going next mod dungeon think character mod right game comment sorry seems like default branch master redownload git clone branch master might able switch master installation seem file best redownload update post comment think mod might able stop control characters time far keep current would nice stream like dungeon multiplayer comment stream channel name stream post stream channel lot way make online multiplayer mod think would comment seems still getting error downloaded game git clone branch master using git bash fine model_v models folder dungeon git bash everything code excluding first bash line enter get applying mods error corrupt patch line error could build fake ancestor use git current patch see failed patch patch failed mods problem run git continue skip patch run git skip instead original branch stop patching run git abort sure going issue comment hang detection character unrestricted mode modify temperature fixes comment sure models folder new installation idea happening maybe git automatically characters use command git system think clone repo see fixes idea could happening comment model_v new installation new dungeon folder one game tried patching make sure try tmr thanks got standalone patches hang detection custom prompt unrestricted mode install fine try two mods tmr standalone patches work install thank mods help comment think adding help command would really nice maybe mods way always back mods game comment one know right comment install mods locally system example work instructions say paste everything first line file run bash work one line says pip install work system would need modified sudo pip install know script work would need modified comment run pip sudo use user instead add local directory path patches work fine git comment hang detection longer works current version comment instructions post downgrade work updates mods comment good collab link mods still work comment oops forgot update update update colab automatically downgrade game version comment awesome thank let know add update make let people know comment thank updating collab link collab link allows online multiplayer collab link mods fail merge online multiplayer collab link comment fatal previous rebase directory git rebase apply still got run cell forgot edit installation cell already comment want switch back character character mod

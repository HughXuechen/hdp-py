google drive workaround game everyone creator aidungeon uncensored found workaround want play game files edit please gdrive workaround way bottom colab link method work matter errors gdrive method amp amp amp colab page follow instructions edit guys miiiight copy files drive physically symlink enter model folder make sure added first drive select files right click press make copy make sure least gigs free space drive exit folder root drive remove original model folder right click make folder called model drag files copied root new folder rename one files proper names cutting copy beginning work really sorry original method work folder linked seems passed daily quota comment saver comment getting error name defined edit nevermind forgot make folder comment sorry would page updated

edit comment make uncensored version comment thanks workaround game comment okay thank comment weird spaces everything looks right keep getting error comment try restarting runtime everything comment deleted comment alright maybe little dumb cells run comment cells little blocks code run press play top left cell comment works thank much comment thanks worked comment running come back want play come back first shit comment files drive run cells play normal around unless delete files comment free guy much run whole thing works comment guy running google google drive free unfortunately quota comment makes completely safe cause problems google drive comment feel access entire google account asks comment amount space files take completely safe cause problems much space first usually tell problem comment run cells third one comment basically asks google drive files access anything google account files drive files model_v folder check code stop using game drive anything might every time want play comment yes cells files drive steps like open colab file run cells last memory increasing one comment thanks comment hey know shit code way one could download whole thing play completely comment sure need amount memory works user pretty difficult difficult even one original working way easier local runtime want get model files download google drive comment deleted comment normal working correctly try restarting running cell increasing memory bottom cell comment would also copying colab file fine keeping running link comment usually might want edit something file comment trying use google drive refuses delete shared model_v folder drive every time refresh back aidungeon work comment deleted comment deleted comment see recent message reply comment one comment filenotfounderror errno file directory generator gpt models model encoder json amp could help thanks comment comment original version back comment comment deleted comment comment comment use torrent

everything works third cell loads minutes error happens comment everything error still happens comment drive refuses get shared one google issue nothing relevant comes people running problem comment game working fine got work initializing dungeon around fix comment seems error original method followed instructions comment try restarting runtime runtime reset runtimes comment issue think stopped working everyone version still works though comment getting error well even new steps comment yeah something google something comment google maybe would work comment likely already updated repo torrent file see updated post comment error followed instructions feel dumb comment think original fix would work downloaded files instead copy think could google file code many people something comment comment update think found reset aidungeon still accessing shared folder drive delete reset runtime delete folder comment deleted comment either save copy notebook drive run playground comment sure definitely comment issue unless trying run torrent trying comment deleted comment run code bottom comment ran torrent utorrent always error comment deleted comment deleted comment hey thanks really appreciate always great see people work hard keep something like alive get step step accessing game pretty comment run download every time new workaround comment get run comment also self comment yes unfortunately comment torrent client download files comment odd definitely able run copy colab notebook try comment basically method user google drive model files google somehow new torrenting method old method works matter need follow colab link instructions comment torrent method works google access gdrive method comment okay likely use vpn comment yeah run files need comment files aidungeon generator gpt models model_v comment still works fine know anything stuff working though comment sometimes works sometimes many file run google drive torrent method method work right great gdrive solution still works comment things sure use torrent step comment use tor option easier free comment okay feel like getting download files every time since torrent get files google drive local copy colab see comment original post upload files folder called model_v tell since gdrive method colab file comment way remove google drive files comment use repo already comment work google drive started download files thought already comment using colab version comment yes started torrent stuff already comment torrenting wait minutes done comment downloaded tor utorrent tor need comment need software makes tor like vpn exactly called software comment downloaded model repo run end error traceback recent call last file play line module play_aidungeon_ file play line play_aidungeon_

please blocks torrenting comment used old solution running files google drive way get working comment sorry late reply new colab file development enable choose method like use gdrive method torrent method soon comment sorry late reply new colab file development enable choose method like use gdrive method torrent method soon comment thanks really appreciate work comment problem comment error

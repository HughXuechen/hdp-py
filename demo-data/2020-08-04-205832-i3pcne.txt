removed limit comment people limit comment never seen devs community feedback way comment right reasoning behind removed great comment got speed devs thanks hard work community feedback seem definitely gives aid seen whether memory taken first characters remember forgotten time characters taken randomly memory word sentence input sure true false anyone confirmation either way comment mean probably idea comment deleted comment want thank devs thank way comment limit still wont going box still use random characters form words time used hard limit place comment yeah literally say wont anything characters purely want even though wont work comment sure true false box let input characters would know characters remembers comment still believe hard memory tab move correct thing especially still pull things memory characters random know anecdotal experience stories memory entries going many characters long would randomly remember things whether memory entries beginning middle end remember tab anecdotal nothing however anyone specifically works sure comment confirmation bias lot people limit remember letting believe idea good take much make see confirmation bias comment pull words random even though characters time change characters remembers put input comment work wont use time comment context characters name place name name see sentence use characters sentence context name response story random nothing would make sense would get random letters word comment mean use characters time change relevant situation still characters prompt comment definitely aid letting forget interacting like interacting definitely experience purely anecdotal wonder works specifically first characters put remember words process everything first characters forgotten time first characters process everything remember tab still take memory tab random example characters memory tab beginning tab put character name end tab put character gender always context character gender end character memory tab sometimes know character gender takes random characters tab time pull random characters character memory hard limit right move every way comment yes seems work well many people comment remember seem anything stuff specific comment memory tab comment think since probably set use time comment simple test characters random memory added familiar purple caterpillar line added top middle memory familiar always vague responses completely different line end memory responses almost always either directly purple caterpillar vague response least usually made sense caterpillar though top middle got response familiar purple something never caterpillar could chance say last characters least end memory comment mean though remember characters remember literally nothing comment really comment mean community feedback change really difference comment characters could use gpt token limit use gpt directly comment would reasoning behind like pretty good comment removed hard limit even still characters remember prompts whether first last especially random time makes least like still world long stories pull random chunk time even pull relevant remember chunk current situation story random pull seems like remembers description remember prompts said still working world info remembers dozen different character use remember prompts current quest story anyone know limit world info entries well continue speed community even sometimes may something seems thank devs comment limit seems removed version still version comment works better right direction example works let say want remember bluedale town full pirates may bring bluedale random story might completely ignore however specifically bluedale one regular inputs like enter town bluedale chance pirates work time probably even time nothing retry sometimes bring info well experience works better information add well story like set new remember village full probably going get anything even specifically bring name village input bet add much use want something work time better using regular inputs keep details want use using example type something like enter pirate town bluedale inputs instead bluedale keep pirate town every inputs comment yeah definitely never either comment using remember box really seem make much difference type sentence comment think limit entries add world info definitely entry character limit said world info work even like least remember works time might test though seen anyone comment also hard time get pull world info entries work sometimes thanks helping keep trying feature sure says thing continue around everything see works continue helping learn feedback comment get work also info remember comment yes new world info entry completely remember three different one correct info world info entry specific character name description word used working story characters remember transitioning three dozen characters world info entries free remember details current quest remember details saved notepad case completely wrecks continuity lol keep trying remember learn improve improved devs time comment working story characters remember transitioning three dozen characters world info entries free remember details current quest remember details saved notepad case completely wrecks continuity lol keep trying remember learn improve improved devs time comment character counter want know limit really limit think comment case wonder add characters remember story comment yeah much see think makes sense since people story remember box though comment say yes counter limit middle something back get stuff comment though want one words cut limit something like read comment says though would cut comment pretty simple good information thank comment way prompts gives like story direction going great one ignore said ignore something comment comment cannot eat thousand cookies time put sign put thousand cookies people sign back still cannot eat thousand cookies time comment know anything anything bet limit comment people comment work remember etc new characters never characters made remember around characters make remember comment lot chance thank comment comment think even though characters memory still memory put relevant end things remember comment deleted comment comment deleted comment prompt comment limit better people comment character seems top bottom yes also seen forget information top bottom also using info middle almost beginning end end seems read first still random comment comment way really comment comment said would comment character count limit token count text form letters also words etc limit almost know takes text character limit comment yeah cookies instead take usually bottom retry feature cookies want eat character remember comment limit back free version memory

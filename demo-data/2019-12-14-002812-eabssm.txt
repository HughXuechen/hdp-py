memory broken breaks turns edit wrong ignore code fix problem misunderstood problem however pretty sure still works much original noted change aware prompt good way replies early custom prompts since remembers story prompt decide works better edit incorrect less bit code story story_manager recent memory next response basically try story prompt last action response pairs put together single text string read time decide write next response people older since bit code question around line method called latest_result uses self story_start first turn uses self context problem story_start contains entire prompt context contains short statement things like name starting using custom prompt context empty entire custom prompt first turn version uses whole story prompt made original context value reason think might still version use custom prompts lot case def latest_result self result_list result_list append self story_start len self results mem_start len result_list self memory mem_start mem_start mem_start len self results result_list append self actions result_list append self results return result_list copy source function version patch written using colab tested yet already seems much aware story prompt use version one problem forgets older commands command limit mentioned story prompt later resolved story might come starts forget original code tries use context full prompt even whole prompt early second command seems solution get around might prompt first turns switching context though still whole prompt turns custom allowing custom prompts context prompt might possible though might bit confusing user use code attention story prompts otherwise might ignore custom prompts comment thanks trying comment sure try comment nick_aidungeon comment way anyone able test please know handles turns know really fix issue around colab longer stories since memory comment every time get play something needs changed stop nice work though right comment tried got indentation error content gdrive drive aidungeon traceback recent call last file play line module story story _manager import file content gdrive drive aidungeon story story _manager line def latest self expected indented block comment python indentation indentation code first line needs indented need indented post indent spaces original source indented python indent source code comment got completely stories think install anyway around original model things comment deleted comment deleted comment deleted comment case likely want say already run internet seems like every hotshot take bad code chance better everyone entire internet coder either entirely see made decisions first self context custom prompts improvement one starting prompt gpt benefit getting character starting prompt going better solution custom prompts context string whole system obviously much improved system anyway second look mem_ind len self results mem_ind latest_result self actions mem_ind self results mem_ind mem_ind seeing forgets results self memory seeing written try set member self memory result end back self memory self results member never self memory test issue self memory number third even short user likely going memory anyway tried improved code block even maybe test bit next time better comment suggestions code submit pull request github repo open source work lot changes since even first code mine incorrect said latest result function gets recent actions results used model everything else sure could try basically nothing game story _start context decisions context meant still actions information change story _start meant start story custom prompts context empty string custom prompt people understand want contribute open source need involved take time understand got improvement please make pull request need write rant comment also getting results replies quotes multiple replies end using case honestly remembers code back default code getting dialogue responses quite comment tried able remember prompt makes big first commands however commands stops sentences even full words onto small pass single bed woman looks bed lie lie woman smiles woman smiles least woman smiles ask woman look around everything breaks point woman text woman modded colab version file modified version function changed version copy story_manager changes well yet test colab comment code also seems make reply dialogue quotes way instead expected situation point tried get multiple next replies dialogue comment noted apologize original post bit initially way code written may bit harsh way meant everything said code said lot anyone code write code come back look wonder thinking forgets everything mem_ind starts value self memory mem _ind subtracted tries loop memory string however block code appends next memory len self results mem_ind results memory never pass mem _ind starts subtracted loop number results never goes never populate action result pairs memory edit also comment test bit better test another post comment change modded colab first responses actually better knows responses breaks completely stops sentences comment wait even tested code author poor code written whole rant better code even tested turns misunderstood code code performing much worse comment giving top suppose hard prompt giving context custom prompts comment know wrong think thinking statement sorry admit original code written bit confusing first even like third onto populate nothing results looks like really bad code result honestly still like suppose really broken way originally thought seems live around user action feels like would nothing work nothing else feel like version still work read lot less confusing problem got first place version still uses full story prompt feel gives better context said problem basically starting command knows function stop prompt see forget prompt entirely memory outside function story pairs every command really see benefit whole prompt early command maybe wait commands forget least started using version code custom prompts got things custom prompt never would solution allowing custom prompts context prompt original post already edit comment apologize mostly hotshot coder seems quite bit really anyway story_manager set self memory started start larion well dragon lives kingdom mentioned except prompt results prompt get know soon top longer girl next ask village eternia reply ask wonder kingdom kingdom larion girl replies know anything place ask name village village eternia live people get ask dragon lives dragon else want memory think reason follow thread latest_result see called story_context called generate_result looks like def generate_result self action block self self story_context action return block latest action getting outside latest_result gives latest_result something comment story_context basically directly result latest_result appends action already worked part figured made sense way latest_result though sure larion default prompts think part prompt put context value makes sense would still see later full prompt story_start gets first turn custom prompts mostly ignored first turn since entire custom prompt goes story_start context empty comment code anything game ask character question comment way post really mean get end much really harsh github originally thought written code way test figured get see response first obviously right call since pull request point would submit code bit opinion may everyone else opinion change way story handles story prompt think better totally sure yet could patch yes yes wrong sorry aware feel still good right way reason otherwise method code might get bit situation many small add one figured even original post discard whole prompt soon get ignored second action case discard memory limit around actions since switching context second action mean custom prompt still totally ignored first turn resolved mean apologize rant write feel like figured something want see pretty hard comment test code worked end test far responses think actually performing worse see reason would anything better except maybe using custom prompt might aware original post poor admit mean author much thought comment test far responses big company uses test new change sure pass comment make issue github submit maybe add test need comment big company literally hardware test colab either get well commands comment feels like right one memory people want solution would nice could get getting results involved story comment thanks hard contribute way open issue pull request github comment dunge ask say fix put colab though dunge repo well repo collab put together better use collab mine pretty using collab modified function latest_result never got dialogue way turns version model drive directly things memory using remember command comment follow everything except indent suggestions spaces indent comment would possible context memory stored gpt uses attention right instead fixed limit action result pairs stored text sentences function sentences words model least attention original prompt even better could model people stories comment literally run hardware colab big company either reason together using colab thread one pull comment get colab run game venv initially copy drive reason copy everything think get error content gdrive drive aidungeon traceback recent call last file play line module story import grammars file content gdrive drive aidungeon story grammars line module import tracery module tracery tracery mydrive aidungeon venv lib mydrive aidungeon venv lib makes think something wrong place edit fixed used colab misunderstood problem add install tracery first comment point stories seems like characters story starting prompt context context story much also allowing story responses edit characters story one actions results comment nick_aidungeon chance way copy characters new story first though trying use remember story many character works another remember command really information like post

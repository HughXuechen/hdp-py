comment damn never knew expensive maintain servers comment name possible know much average subscriber needs contribute become solvent comment use dungeon utilize story mode long still lets input text gpt text continue paying subscription feature goes away likely would said understand cost dungeon one accessible ways utilize gpt right main reason paying dungeon allowed gpt time though gpt private api accessible rest developers comment yeah literally one advanced ais world cheap haha comment specific number make subscription tier would significantly higher current price instead looking like app purchase worlds different tiers etc comment would expect free version become limited actually kind game free version long comment way computer load like folding home possible download dragon offline play cost comment learning gpu yes haha comment would imagine load would increase cost instead computer costing might computers costing folding home works computing power comment good way run massive models distributed cloud computers right would though comment thinking speed work computers might actually everything one computer possible run laptop speed one word acceptable comment actually know model run know around gpus way linked nodes would like nodes comment using one ais world make stories might sound like sort makes much sense could help comment yeah probably actually wanted conservative even cost difference pretty well comment well scary uninformative hope turns something would definitely pay good money stuff raw gpt stories likely want pay need death kinda stuff comment imagine problem really paying subscribers free users still needs lot gpu time run gpt gpt cents every tokens played scenario words using public options would paying openai generate scenario however reading like hours minutes spent reading roughly text average paying users less active months probably less subscription comment one thing know generated tokens prompt tokens well get prompt tokens generated tokens one action tokens one action comment tokens words know tokenizer works tokens length used also length might fact text instead comment explore free tier tokens three month trial use first per month tokens plus cents every additional tokens build per month tokens plus cents every additional tokens scale openai pricing amp damn really expensive referring tokens anyone know per word usage aidungeon months used words probably words generated think could make due explore tier dungeon great way utilize software hope limitations adding limit much raw enter text use right enter text story telling looking stop writing get block dungeon continue text refresh get going makes sense edit said fit real world places names story places names amp really enjoy using dungeon however base taken away seems like using gpt released might financially viable option especially free tier comment guys great truly guys whatever personally really done far wish best comment mean main understand vram system ram least work need crazy ram cards used local early version system ram minute laptop thing even griffon model usually actions given story say unless shady sysadmin going pull griffon without investment comment thank done without support community comment interesting direct end result many words story cost anything context used words story content etc every action costs see getting expensive especially large amount users comment made ago gpt gpt tokenizer gpt gpt gpt say covering filtering filtering roughly byte pair tokens could due byte level tokenizer gpt almost byte pair thing possible tokens different tokens anything token ids another special characters like token ids words like futuristic like futuristic token make used token comment know one person would much rather either pay higher monthly fee one time upgrade deal iaps hopefully option thank loving dragon hope openai cut kind deal something keep going comment gonna app purchases suggest gpt comment honestly best solution make app something like comment use premium version play much free money comment idea others would gladly dungeon good amount lot places need maybe one plus premium would ads comment never cover costs unfortunately unless like week comment yeah whatever least need purchase price comment opposite want need people least higher people paying time since active users constantly using expensive compute time subscription cut potential convert free users real opportunity probably pretty numbers free premium make free users less costly one time pay means many people getting app thus convert subscriber still bunch users paying still costing money regular basis problem dungeon reason many apps use model free tier premium subscription tier course apps incur cost free user need large premium question really reduce costs free users increasing ratio premium users comment saying idea likely drive many away potential users payment griffon could profitable people made first payment much likely subscribe premium month comment question really reduce costs free users increasing ratio premium users probably reduce free users plus action limit users iaps comment say surprised happy pay higher subscription cost comes comment yeah like said feature people would voluntarily watch ads think banner ads would work option voluntarily watch bigger ads perhaps even unlocking features watch enough month comment happily pay monthly keep using dragon one best tools writer writer block times count hopefully guys figure comment think would drive people away possibly look asked pay cost subscription fee act like business advertising banner ads options watch bigger ads possible like premium features like maybe able play randomness bit something ads comment hope able investment find options let remain solvent offer free version written stories users free premium consider access scenarios adventures may become locked future comment massive shame job back premium amp hoping find solution game possibly best ever played never seen anything like work thank much comment would never lock access adventures etc cost per action reason lock anything already comment think problem funding many people actually know aidungeon video look app put radar maybe run short know love software idea subscription models users incur higher average costs users subscribe use service often use basis subscription based system think etc free model however also means money subscribers also funding free model going keep free model suggest least mobile version ads mobile user base mobile users different mobile users expect premium version ads comment wow thank much quick case would even way consider kind option like already pretty high know hate dungeon worth way sucks even benefit access would ads day development team really want see continue wish could say hope find ads content works comment deleted comment guys even get money host dragon first place making premium comment know ads best least help comment guess cloud comment nothing else would least free users cost money without actually paying subscription comment remember really early version game could download run fall apart turns comment probably biggest point would help biggest cost dungeon done free users crazy ads use comment say want would happily pay premium mode features added satisfied premium pay comment also loving dragon hope premium user mean features locked behind comment back lot actions first comment much keeping bells cost per action telling get far computer knowing put game certainly worth every single server comment scary uninformative like rest game comment one cost mean without electricity bill comment problem advertising even losing money paid users whole getting users might give time need per user cost even consider user count comment deleted comment would help driving people away thus reducing running cost servers comment host dragon openai comment obtrusive ads stop playing yes couple well placed banner ads probably would comment dragon probably costs significantly paying human would comment would gladly pay dollars month maybe even premium knew team going continue censor game unfortunately seem case comment already done incredible honestly surprised see system point development law play part pricing costs least computing power every months even dungeon financially viable couple years well could able run like helps making pay premium would happy pay least long features censorship article custom keeps coming back could care less worlds see might draw people especially world remember want play perhaps limiting free model certain number actions per month would help demo subscription model something like free demo basic limits premium limits guess important thing money going coming costing costing least hopefully financial team comment mind free version act like demo draw people often offer free certain level hope affect premium increasing price start losing features getting ads censorship app purchases premium sub comment ways censor game assuming nsfw like know assuming real comment ever used griffin still happy could something like unlimited gpt usage limited monthly griffin usage tier monthly unlimited griffin usage limited monthly dragon usage tier unlimited griffin usage monthly dragon usage tier unlimited dragon usage special experimental features comment since seems many people refresh generated text happy gpt might actually result less costs since less text players therefore refresh often reducing speed fast text screen free players might also play slower therefore fast reading players edit considered paying options like comment agree limited amount action per month even week keeps free players coming back enjoy want pay makes cost get surprised also custom mode amazing would get exposure especially free players made couple subscribe comment would bring censorship anything would lose subscribers chance bringing sure maybe add premium features tier could work although agree limiting free still think basic banner ads could good option placed comment yeah literally censored word nsfw comment already done one word actually kind agree also kind nothing else censored think users would make sense little couple weeks ago basically nsfw even going way exact opposite hoping things come nick said nsfw works gives hope right though many people sub nsfw stuff adventures nsfw removing would lot subscribers comment word ends far tell nothing else censored like since game released one hand limiting freedom written word hand kind makes people use one getting enter one word things happen comment far let hope way words get added comment affect personally like want support team comment extra horny couple weeks ago remember like exact removing nsfw however making version like people interested edit got time wrong extra horny however still comment talking intend whole thing could easily fall apart many words would censor even including story significant without actual act comment intend one word however fact done one done stance freedom basic human right hopefully nothing comes comment two apps might make lot sense way two comment said oppose censorship freedom human right long used hate limit rights limitations placed freedom speech pretty much action article often speech general made clear article comment course people find ways well able twitter allowed higher lets say get yeah agree freedom speech important perhaps important human right think censorship dungeon comment think would interesting least imagine could perhaps interesting sort story writing makes tools made idea mind could know people written stories stuff dungeon comment deleted comment since september nsfw clear added something know certain instead lines characters telling others enough sometimes clear game goes know say text would words know able trigger knowing say already need explicit something enjoyed subtle possible read lines though guess september character name involved nsfw long time ago story name comes back say start people reason one nsfw name future bring name one even need subtle though believe people explicit anyway comment cough cough build separate website nsfw part game since well griffin people willing pay kind stuff could basically new model stuff model much dragon basically website would used one costly run model griffin size enough see big talking people censorship thing find aidungeon uncensored found advertised model erotic text generate sure could get access whole would willing subscribe interested playing adventure games advertised know aidungeon thing cough cough comment people looks around comment referring people written actually using dungeon yeah comment deleted comment based length comment feel first well live comment done comment mentioned need idea subscription model absolutely right though especially second part mentioned honestly could pay amount run aidungeon home server months years care minutes slower server hardware comment openai pricing problem tier free read public adventures tokens tokens month tokens month could increase time goes api access could players might price also drop griffin comment deleted comment ends might although amazing rap battles comment would price premium much love game death tell everyone able pay like month current financial situation comment thanks got thinking erotic rap battles comment say satisfied month premium updated think keeping available free users even important remember one way another people going access free stuff limited even mind seems like financially viable option would limiting users unless pay action limits trial version griffin price premium sucks business numbers two cents comment business likely comment mind say banner side times might actually stop playing actually video ads like comment agree optional let say option watch bigger ads support developers place ads appear would fine banner ads might appear top screen places would fit comment sounds like increase monthly cost game beyond acceptable users add optional paid features top dragon available separate either like purchase kind side subscription basically thing want also option seem pay per token system players must pay cut dragon using month game costs run make running sounds like devs would keep one price premium service could costs high think going willing pay kind want game continue comment would rate replies free users make significant difference something like replies rolling gets many replies new replies start keep rolling average sure would good numbers btw current rate close premium users covering costs comment word point anyone little bit kind situation without using word comment electricity bill comment guess sad come comment point likely happen increase users get premium play limit many actions make month want know guys thinking comment pretty much comment thing free version people even finding comment shame gladly contribute gpu compute sort distributed system could even tokens future comment already done one word actually kind agree also consenting adults play fetish two people person single person computer text yes wrong playing pretend consenting adults comment almost trigger dragon new quick question though dragon sort api access instead browser app comment guys gonna comment hardware dungeon still remain free good mobile comment also datacenter assuming running big case probably want big fat fiber pipe running house comment personally find nothing wrong twitter gonna worried openai pull dungeon censor way beyond remember microsoft comment see comment seen context people wanted uncensored people want type insert character however still oppose censorship written word read stories know stance consenting adults business fetish play like suggest something like comment direct law article human rights comment really really really want guys amazing job honestly know expensive maintain long much one premium love comment well wish best guys updated game love worried future feel like dungeon still pretty game surprised costs revenue mind comment seen context people wanted uncensored people want type insert character one person computer playing pretend mean actually kind agree exactly comment maybe make paid game browser version like demo good even scary sometimes comment people think work single words able characters something plus garbage garbage makes make person censorship bad comment shady sysadmin comment fat near nick house away kid pipe hand spent everything server mean build real fiber cable pretend fiber cable kid comment deleted comment yeah thing could possibly cut without driving current still bringing new people still keeping app free players like said many times basic banner advertisements might least help cover cost lower least without removing features comment even like vram run hardware comment would chance getting openai game given general exposure dungeon kinda small lot comment looks like adding patreon top premium playing lot must costing bunch taken playing parallel world world one get others bob gets local gang called add gang worlds well whatever bob specific story cheap run comment sad day comment ads would good comment truly hope find model work keep game running enjoyed great deal would hate see comment much amount vram griffin found vram version expect one one might able run much much linked much gpu linked new generation single run griffin likely able run griffin well least model close size comment pay dollars month easily added nsfw version griffon yes expensive probably still cover costs people pay wow subscription plus dollars comment free version could two three generations behind whatever upcoming current version lower cost paid version could whatever first second generation behind upcoming current could also pay access experimental future generations may may well generation free version one premium happy comment possibility could free users asked advertisements play number hours free ads agree watch play one per hour seems especially free users really utilize hour two playing plus much costs run upgrade dungeon maybe little bar much revenue dungeon made like day week sort like comment new offline version called less bunch bells like dungeon comment premium feature one time payment subscription based payment btw keep great work devs comment adding tiers patreon advertise increasing price best tier lower tier comment possibility still think could work unlocking premium feature like randomness couple games something would work best comment adverts important comment one would ever interested crazy fantasy world live else tell fantasy world already two based near less nsfw text adventure games make month yeah right comment amd comment believe pretty guys come may comment use little one use current pricing even enough cover costs comment run byu doubt make nsfw version nsfw months due comment money could buy server tesla every two months opportunity would short sighted people already using anyway people using private stories least private stories nsfw people free comment financially yes would short sighted byu university university sexually run recently underage girls color panties make sure slutty sexually conservative surprised willing content especially using university resources fine wrong would certainly surprised could also byu direct active university resources involved comment comment need rtx play advanced games rtx games highest graphics need highest graphics games system built around rtx ram think running learning constantly exactly get problem running everyone griffin one tesla really sound possible case dragon running way less users paying think drop much would getting back people paying even month would paying think need give many cards actually running many cards actually need rather making rather gpus give actual numbers want give benefit doubt bit rtx making see said keep dark considered letting players contribute processing power comment think actual processing sort parallel computing likely bunch regular home computing time datacenter something sort comment game crazy power costs much like extra purchases get need aidungeon still radar get names something absolutely incredible let community know people would money game like many something helps make come comment problem right person unless pay actions costing money average even pay premium likely losing aid money adding people problem premium money patreon money cost maintain aid cost per action users recently cost per action users deal september openai released new pricing gpt pretty realistically seem limit many actions players per time including premium members add bunch app purchases members things like new worlds scenarios tools openai pricing end different model comment sure finding companies enough limit advertising unobtrusive banner ads also care might content reason porn sites sites etc adverts want realistically ads would either obtrusive game censorship comment banner advertisements really problem find unobtrusive like something companies exactly problem advertising nsfw either seen still gets ads definitely content want advertise lot porn still see adverts usually get much way seems possible least get advertising especially dungeon gets comment paid version subscription increase limit characters fit comment ads honestly mind couple ads dungeon free comment hope something like thanks exactly problem telling anything like basically saying need money tesla cards cost lot makes absolutely sense given hardware cost already want know really costing much since keeping dark comment interested color panties underage girls built scale slutty mind nothing think first buy service even want imagine comment amd cpus garbage cpus amd gpus good compute compute means access like comment thing need profitable getting people use service help still makes lose money need figure make comment imagine could limited number replies allowed per minute rolling average like bar time also pay little amount pay much run extra get replies rate use comment host dragon hardware get idea costly openai gives microsoft access simply use api access costs per token including prompt tokens per month could token per word least tokens per action user input yeah bad likely scenario aid simply close get special deal openai letting use small cost

needs remember anything everything comment dragon need remember playing anything fantasy universe like universe playing non human character non human characters need remember assuming human comment see played fantasy dragon would even aware using dragon first time ever played griffin capable fantasy breaking comment run ways things memory work text seems memory comment advice going call anything comes close another function purpose good advice though comment think good advice character course best game way comment way managed get coherent story remember character race played story comment scripts help first memory scripting second looks back one tried looks pretty even though comment clear tried yet looks useful comment text scripts new scenario comment get think wrong way purposefully function useful make remember rather play whole game story prompt would writing book try make devs purposefully try quality game tell devs game either fix user experience assuming experience comment think looking scripting character limit put comment experience aid team game devs experience aid team thus optimistic though wrong maybe often right said new community said discord channels part comes high community team channels know things like long term player know things regards making every player aid say majority users comment discord help could perhaps comment saying majority users want coherent story comment saying game developers always get players regards players different ways want play game one making whole seems make course developers aware players story consistency know change improving long run step towards perhaps limiting remember function character towards accurately call information within step towards improving worldinfo intended users using memory worldinfo memory improving consistency serve different makes memory limit contextual story thus worldinfo world building see people devs making change without actually change bug fix change know memory always technical limitations everything limit correctly anyway comment true character got slime running random well slime think function race remember story comment maybe lot time slime comment put much devs seen game rather optimistic one either amp never desire part community discord want kind well amp kind agree think agree memory story writing needs able parse characters memory memory access characters time amp know read characters remember time still even yet think also seemed capable read assume call bugfix breaking thing makes griffin function purpose comment first maybe limit would know see perhaps want day made read memory say text neither tell could characters memory info within comment worldinfo memory long term consistency world building memory remember kind kind thing first arbitrarily imposed limit memory always limitations limitations addressed worldinfo bug fix never intended users assume memory capable actually worldinfo long term world building memory contextual information worldinfo gets keys less thus memory gets input serve data technical capabilities correctly parse characters memory much worldinfo make better anyway comment said check notes limit limit always limit still characters technical much want also note world data editable game limit never new change never able characters memory accurately devs made clear comment check notes make clear character limit change never true never user users going characters aware parse anything bug letting users limit thinking one technical limit one ever arbitrarily imposed developers comment say check note really memory story world info capabilities ended thought world info editable really help scenario using think already characters know new needs make right world info managed bugfix nice day comment nice day well comment thing multi game going noticed little one back story like new book needs needed

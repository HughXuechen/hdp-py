alternate monetization suggestions dont use stamina system using stamina system one sure way kill entire game seriously one mobile games pull stuff especially already paying users access would pretty get need extra revenue suggest alternate revenue options easy way kill new stamina system keep mind already people paying system also adding another cost top get need keep wrong way ideas need money right gotta make ends meet totally still ideas first lets basic thing overall increase price dragon pretty sure would understand simply said gotta increase price jack per month easy way get income guarantee people take paying extra dollars per month instead time locked new stamina system amp cosmetics would cosmetics work website like simple things page allow players buy colors effects like little stuff screen background music entire themes etc something basic could colors inestead back background could maybe buy red idk basic colors effects remember like old little effects playing yeah something like maybe sort something basic like music yeah basic background music play maybe different text overall entire themes christmas coming sell theme christmas music red background color effect maybe something like could also add profile effects profile ways make profile look like background could also various would suprised much people willing pay cosmetics different ways dragon less sure think could maybe make people would otherwise buy dragon various options one time payment drop cash lets say dunno lifetime access different models maybe pay bit months access inestead stuff like lets say per month maybe months maybe months idk random arround narrators narrators dragon right could buy various narrator voices could basic different like maybe buy voices different something maybe ones like something stupid like various dragon features lets say dont want dragon want extra settings want narrators something like well offered various features person buy lets say sell extra settings pack narrator pack dragon maybe people would buy could lets say one time payment thing either pay make cheaper monthly pay per month drop much cash cheaper option everyone amp bundles features also sell bundles going back christmas lets say sell chirstmas bundle chirstmas theme music narrator new one lets say cheaper separate features otherwise would reason buy bundle amp version dunno could could put something like steam people pay access get aidungeon local random amp different subscription tiers idea simple add different subscription systems might make people would otherwise pay pay extra drop cash tiers sure could could add basic features tier dragon subscription model something like basic free griffon tier griffon aditional settings tier dragon aditional settings narrator tier dragon settings narrator extra customization options stuff stories amp ads simple add adds one top screen maybe one maybe make adds recharge energy idk idea extra models stuff drop money use lot dont add much extra costs well lower tiers price higher tiers anyways ideas suggest aidungeon monetization using rather stamina personal would jack price dragon atleast costs various monetization systems help want turn back later stamina big put free users rather atleast kind much amp edit added ideas profile effects etc cosmetics various subscription tiers edit added ads comment would totally buy stuff like themes stuff one used time would also willing pay dragon play dungeon time play way work way home home play hours watch youtube play home spend lot time trying get output exactly looking using lot going back text output lot comment problem paying use openai unlimited use costs exceed flat rate limiting usage certain amount actions creates cost run per user cost per user amount user paying none solutions guarantee comment well give revenue options allow make price comment yes comment offered lifetime dragon bucks think every single subscriber would buy would costs almost lifetime subscription based costs would thousands simply expensive run certainly chose bad way comment looking increase dragon users costing per per month right looking least month unlimited access lifetime subscriptions would thousands dollars people pay honestly think good way fund game openai power gets cheaper comment said probably cover cost add instead comment deleted comment deleted comment thing price premium already went months ago double would make people even less buy subscription start adding comment buy subscription pay already increasing griffin access would away entirely comment forcing people pay extra dollar gonna cover adding flat per month think free users spend money system would extremely annoying limiting work annoying system people would pay certain people gonna leave comment yeah time would probably work well thats said kinda comment forcing people pay another every idk words going cover amp getting people stop using costs comment pay use system pretty fair power users huge amount resources pay users power users costs power users pay costs use system extra amount money users amount want put dungeon mobile heavy premium users actually comment yeah think energy long tbh putting people going stop using like like dragon scales kind still work latitude saying keep people leave leading drop payment leading know monetization keep running fucking stamina comment wouldnt also invested users dropping cash alternate monetizations idea would think use dungeon lot would probably drop cash one website stuff atleast make stamina system much less monetizations cover cost partially comment like put lot effort post hope goes long way let dungeon die like comment buy although comment tbh comment going charging like atleast open option gpt access comment yeah creates balance power users users comment actually pretty simple solution subscription tiers actions month way income action comment add ads banner ads opt ads pop ads maybe add add free charge monthly subscribers get ads comment compute real cost killer openai fees openai went money one although ever since would happen comment jack price subscription way forget subscribers live dollar pay much increasing price bucks cost comment openai fees killer partially power run gpt high come said gpt large run one big companies could afford run open source comment basically already selling actions comment already gonna bankrupt months current rate start money user comment would pay bucks month unlimited dragon fucking comment started playing dungeon seem like problem personally get actions every day never ever exceed say though comment one game keep hours start playing nothing else stamina limit would really get comment maybe run ads like worst possible thing comment ads make enough money stop going bankrupt comment dragon would comment find way charge power users stop power users playing much aidungeon months power users even premium costing much money right comment point better away gpt certainly feels like rate gonna sustainable long right maybe fucking stupid comment comment ads might cover dragon model entirely would lose subscribers pretty much reason people banner ads really make much money unless lot lot traffic people would complain ads lose people ads amp kinda lose lose situation think stamina system good idea also really better option moment comment disagree think solution would better stamina situation would even fine added stamina bar let watch ads agree disagree comment disagree ads would better ads make enough money sustain one banner pull thousands month heck even banner adds come close point screen like banner ads remember old site traffic aidungeon made like month one banner nowhere near enough keep game alive comment said pop ads opt ads need also comment dont live either amp every dollar arround money due almost double comment buy scales even using energy extremely sub say actions hours still going around subscription scales maybe even need subscription idk non subscribers use dragon scales getting tens thousands actions month using dragon start become price reason allowed unlimited access since top dragon users made sort limit possible option comment mean losing power users one way cut dragon costs really need find alternate way comment ads ads mtx dragon scale buyers etc stuff probably good job atleast comment pop adds solutions well pop ads banner ads opt adds add cosmetics people buy maybe jack price dragon bit stuff net gain money help lot hell keep stamina maybe bit monetization systems comment agree comment agree point either dropping back griffon exclusively completely different model probably best course action get costs control comment deleted comment fan ads whatever else long stamina bar comment problem serious aidungeon users run large actions day experience made much worse comment yes much way make people feel upset actions per month comment really something control guys openai comment much rather cost month game ads free players like dollar one charge griffin free think would much better would enough know paying month game buy microtransactions comment oai say oai making quite lot money cash cost compute really quite cheap nowadays platform like aws azure sure cost openai server scale oai fault comment worse comment pay per action system dragon way another unless openai make ton money one stamina bars mtx features feel product comment simple way use actions month screwed least recharge someone use play hour sessions almost put place find comment something dragon costs griffon fine basic free hardware run even run gpt model use griffin free every action used dragon openai gpt oai literally actions everything oai latitude latitude small oai basically get oai drop simply something make numbers either make dragon actions cost something limit actions simply drop dragon option latitude money dragon comment opinion would rather shut game matter time anyways look many people jumping ship speak going cost money gain lol comment server side maybe allow users turn computer server servers sound completely stupid question right comment vast majority people jumping ship griffon honestly open usage free high amount actions allowed due low costs literally nothing paying nothing done still possible business losing paying nothing actually good aid game need large playerbase alive people pay nothing nothing lower costs want play gpt free hard unless really really computer comment paying used dragon look posts vast majority already clover nothing new comment vast majority jumping ship dragon users yes already clover well oai charging costs going everyone lot would charge per action chose really way charging per action comment cosmetics somewhat possible custom user see aid customization aid themes custom music sounds feel people would putting youtube background comment said actions month would better disagree say way better screwed run actions month posts large amount dragon users least said dropping subscription end see happens think every cost running game going shut rather later comment yeah would people turn options comment monthly like scales per month worse might forget done whether actions would month month feels better maybe devs get revenue per action comment would actions month using scales stamina mtx people comment absolutely feel note amount people saying pay higher cost subscription people complain stamina bars like mobile game even page post looking like product end pay per action either way one feel bad comment sounds better still good really long play sessions whatever clover comment developers yet comment behind better feel microtransactions pay extra think games run one course days know fair rate would affordable higher subscription model active users afford better charge hour rather worth monthly usage comment become monetization person thing lol actually dont would bankrupt lol comment really little people understand costs running service like kind hardware takes run simulations like real time run things servers vram vram nvidia guys know much costs costs much nvidia even bother like could never afford devs servers run server handle one request time takes server handle one request dragon model still processing simulations due technically service players single server handle small active players time single servers handle thousands scale tens thousands dungeon users time get seem like text much hard willing pay costs run gonna gonna die monetization gonna die users willing pay costs run saying fault users job companies also devs devs trying least even cost worth paying comment dont understand super active users paying every days makes ends meet question monetization options wouldnt less way way thats inestead experience something even casuals buy casuals gonna paying gonna comment realistic option everything increasing price none others viable around say would fine price increase unlimited high energy subscription top premium subscription sort tiered subscription system effect essentially price increase users actually draining resources makes fair use pay exactly everyone fine right sub lose mind happens comment dont see options cash side wouldnt work though especially adding ways non paying users comment none options would enough revenue even bother implementing going sell cosmetics text based game serious going want ads game sort stuff dungeon one time purchase would make things worse selling access local version work guarantee single person computer run gpt literally get patreon people extra nothing comment problem servers lot processing power said server costs around local version technically comment think would suprised stuff people willing pay people drop cash games get profile avatar dont see wouldnt people post said themes would insta buy like background color lot effort either thing would start making one patreon thing could work comment see anyways comment problem stamina thing like get like makes sense since free griffin model pretty times especially stories actually invested want things atleast somewhat pretty sure many others agree adding pay actions good make people pay away comment lot get type lol comment hope would like maybe hours instead whole hours comment people drop cash games get profile avatar dont see wouldnt doubt people would enough people pay servers people post said themes would insta buy almost exclusively people never buy theme comment revenue source sure could probably without much effort cash comment seriously look microtransactions understand coming place need buy time need ads never viable price bad many people willing spend heck already model even well really customizations locked behind microtransactions ever comment posts dragon players subscriptions sure guess based game works might better since cheaper see make work even done best feels wrong really hope find dragon players also customizations one least things behind mtx comment need stop think moment whether good idea spend time implementing something pay maybe one day worth costs per month money time implementing microtransactions like ship everything really whether running yeah technically kinda comment mad fine obviously better ever feel like mad everyone mad want still see dungeon years might well years kind cost want see least better right solution play less want play right away pay better able comment many play around words anyway comment could see narrators music making ton money also sound effects like type different sound effects comment actually works many buyers little supply increase price still buyers supply increase price still still till balance business sustainable devs users business model money something affordable goes price till enough gets shut lets hope increase price enough buyers sustain kinda doubt draining since day comment nothing wrong post like mobile game started way play phone pretty comment rather pay fucking games stamina system phone games limited use dungeon help pay monthly comment gpt public obviously people play text game makes sense let big companies happen enough cash fund hardware people comment suggestions one time purchase even griffin model requires separate payment every action dragon requires much money run griffin subscription costs tiers would work ads also net worth low unless want see ones comment users source net dungeon though would viable users subscriptions since even close server time current payment model honestly dragon believe ahead time public costs run moment make subscriber monthly cost without comment essentially two options fair realistic tiered subscription system stamina system really fan using two though say purchase limited amount actions dragon model without subscription comment someone sense comment dunno ads annoying live stupid fucking stamina bar comment better idea worth dragon cut cost game running lot premium would still used would free users also cosmetics good way ads developers comment agree everything said especially point cheap action another matter would price increase pay extra bucks immune leave energy system free players think adding extra non features one adding another subscription tier dragon would also see anyway tier one could cheap give people extended energy bar tier could give dragon bucks extended energy tier could month make immune system seems like win win yes lose another price increase already moment immune literally ago comment cost compute really quite cheap nowadays platform like aws azure hell even azure getting huge comment makes sense comment expensive right though years able run human level personal computer mean know many maybe take people think human level still quite ways know could playing dragon though comment guess kind bad almost entire cost goes paying model actually could wrong comment lot people fine price increase opinion stamina system price increase first sub would still numbers around certain players costing month would still need limit people resources access give lot heavy players going upset matter people comment place limit worst sure entire playerbase seems pay month play hours times month want limited stamina edit side note speak sub personally would pay month valid justification good reason believe still enough another increase valid justification already dragon super expensive get comment oai probably comment ads added literally every user site would cover even subscriptions would everyone especially pop ads everyone using least absolutely worth comment would totally buy steam comment mean ahead things like would give people money either keep things completely cost dragon hell think whole yet nowhere near maybe aid

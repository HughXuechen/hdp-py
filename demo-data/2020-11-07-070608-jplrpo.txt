figure changes make comment thankyou listening feedback updating seems premium users want pay year limited microtransactions people would understanding onto website comment find happy middle ground subscribers comment really update nick understand tough situation lie say really see planned stamina system ever way ruin current game really hope guys alternative options one comment listening feedback still going full ahead energy system gotten backlash lost many subscriptions comment fully support decision keep subscribed end comment hope good middle ground found think people would stamina bar added ads refill energy used ads complete energy comment sucks creativity costs guys figure take time love guys hope best comment comment sorry community toxic keep good work comment yeah also never energy system beforehand implemented discord planned roll instead updating everyone likely backlash poll suggestion different ways monetization community response mention statistics announcement energy system seems like way community statistics numbers instead actually trying get suggestions beforehand cancelling subscription support energy system like playing pay play freemium mobile game especially already paying monthly comment hey nick know getting tons negative feedback wanna say love aid understand gpt expensive fuck keep keep comment one thing see much people leave dragon think money gonna saved adding microtransactions say either drop energy bar make little reasonable like maybe actions something one premium user understand dragon benefits anything thinking comment deleted comment sure one person subscribed year cover entire upkeep costs company issue introducing microtransactions allow users choose much want pay even paying premium service costing still energy bar free users dealing think solution simple time premium users action every minutes instead action every would make comment dragon away hard cap inputs keep project think many would understand rather functioning griffon dead dragon comment possible start limiting undo redos user use lot free idea much saved start thinking many actions player per day also mind pay extra features like think people would fair pay dollars alone could make scales comment deleted comment hey devs like guys game lot know way scales stamina bar look sounds bad idea going though maybe make users paying dragon get faster charge rate say log back days maybe get like another actions top play every day play multiple times week way actions still gonna cost much willing let dragon force use griffin servers like used played griffin option alright even long option works griffin alright comment comment sounds like slightly dragon cost much run maybe different tiers amount actions premium user model alongside monetization tactics users suggested help keep taking much space server make sustainable premium users would understand griffin may unplayable users atleast push redo cost actions comment really appreciate things dev team done game even agree everything added energy system implemented seen times past devs quick community wants seem really appreciate hope middle ground reached dungeon absolutely thing would lot see die especially since get tough times really love dungeon community amazing things created together using edge type since back community much alongside many others grow amazing thing today really hurts see many people saying leave dungeon energy system implemented completely understand decisions really hope fair reasonable middle ground reached want say something impact life many others especially times comment removed comment think giving one two extra free retries making clear premium gets instead would clear backlash comment must huge subscriber comment could used griffon say think worth use better model worry next customers words kill game faster comment creativity server traffic server traffic cost cost big problem stamina temporary solution comment dropped exactly like many get need make money people already paying bad move comment really understand reasoning behind system really see one major problem max capacity energy actions low play run actions minutes wait hours kinda forces players play short bursts stories basically makes player stories obsolete nobody play adventures think capacity much higher players able decide want play sessions actions maybe long session actions stamina system think form bit unacceptable love aidungeon amazing work looking project literally initial release google guys amazing work know working hard provide best experience much players possible understand costs high see working searching listening feedback hope able make ideas find solutions comment would completely understand banner ads website comment minutes lot time sure premium cost little delay enough break flow playing comment multiple premium tiers different rate replies per minute comment another thread someone suggested income non dragon features available premium non premium users reasonable price comment add energy premium subscription avoid way keep best worlds comment griffin used free accounts add much impact running costs would adding small delay seconds less probably would always present free accounts make enough impact comment honestly tiered system would fantastic personally dragon model writing dragon amazing keeping stories world keep remember hours without actions dragon keeps everything griffon requires want sessions keeping griffon track forces characters adventures kill reason maybe griffon good average person trying make work pay premium actions hour playtime scale system work want pay unlimited access dragon price seen people mention would take month bother since pay games anymore aid fantastic addition writing especially year one power users left behind comment thought simply making subscription fee higher instead system tell right energy system would much rather pay paying sub right avoid ever seeing comment honestly think best solution might axe dragon focus griffon less expensive ways probably add premium features make rather griffon limited dragon even worse dungeon comment think might good idea maybe poll everyone app ask watching ads different subscription maybe energy bar comment may bit unrelated paper google last month redo attention performers make time scale instead currently number tokens also theory gpt could retrained performers probably lot faster cheaper run griffin models could also retrained performers look paper dotted lines would old full lines see dotted lines upwards full ones pretty log seconds seconds alone would cut time gpt like actual performance current good growing year probably get similar performance way cheaper costs growing user base make business sustainable development gets better think could good move comment fully understand stamina system system work max capacity low keep refill rate increase cap everyone still gets energy back every hours energy cap maybe caps like something someone uses hold playing days want full refill way play long play sessions instead many short ones keeps much played comment dungeon one games play feeling well enough play action games really love created said understand dragon costs keep would gladly pay twice much premium subscription worry stamina meter dragon know cost dragon would gladly pay sort premium super user subscription amount actions could stamina bar comment like others user would willing pay larger sub unlimited use world ever paying sub dealing annoying gacha like timer actions timer present subs pay sub want full access willing pay money top like worlds instance taking look many actions roughly game reach actions course days usually bursts rather daily would add going number see anything current energy model simply able use system unless pay actions per timer comment two major issues said plenty someone paid subscription someone game subscriptions dungeon ever annoying feel like product paying unless pay need money need solution seems almost like designed feel like face premium users year price sure many subscribers insignificant second energy bar whole cap responses need retry twice five times even get response feel story probably really push edge make cancel like feeling story energy using product pay year appreciate needs work comment deleted comment see coming expensive run current model implement first place planning bleeding playerbase aidungeon whales along want die never sustainable without kind payment model even bother face game unplayable state nobody wants engage payment model aidungeon simply work regular mobile game micro transactions wait mechanics even really game per limiting retries limiting amount times use farmville whatever play kinds design people financially games also unrelated note anyone information sell third parties third parties sell read seeing stuff little comment sure put microtransactions implemented microtransactions comment energy bar make want cancel subscription moment see would even willing pay higher premium subscription fee get ads play time though comment roll ads website get microtransactions long ads give people bad time okay roll comment used love thing dungeon great used lot see would would get even non dragon gacha energy bar max slow along uses things like correct keep track makes disappointed angry disappointed fact way statistics like think knew going backlash could found way community ideas end even way bar least tried dragon great sounds like bit could guys rather feature gacha tactics community even imagine much income lost actually system imagine insignificant numbers return subscribers also comment developer temporary solution find way without microtransactions comment aidungeon simply freemium mobile game model play like games imagine someone getting addicted aidungeon way people get addicted farmville whatever say aidungeon addictive addictive way models designed pay keep flow state going stamina bar one first place could make stamina bar actions maybe people would start new every time latitude get freemium models apps aidungeon people play provide better solution comment user anything move made dragon already paying subscription sort going support addition microtransactions comment accept feel bad devs paying customers sell microtransactions kind unacceptable planned comment devs problem going towards microtransactions first solution definitely makes sound like run service costs get way one cancelling sub comment like using reddit fact hate using reddit announcement gave make account actually type comment premium user means pay currency feel premium users limited use stamina mechanic got break really costs comes running servers games premium users cost money non premium users way people thread developers made sound premium users far premium users probably big hit income amp premium users ever get stamina mechanic support pay subscription things free players deal comment right normal microtransactions designed make people feel like give edge people pay like pay afford support game wait recharge deal pay use want instead paying everyone especially important since small user base costing introducing energy bar great comment deleted comment disagree microtransactions correct working wrong dragon griffin different uses gpt dragon lot griffin devs issues upkeep servers dragon needs lot griffin comment paying sub micro transactions understand need make money okay going removed premium subs look options like ads free players mobile hard reach cap super whales running server cost comment initial reaction bad thinking would fuck premium users like bad seems getting announcement amp understand shift energy may difficult active users affected especially sensitive impact change premium users help ease transition premium users receive dragon scales time membership renews working add benefits like unlimited griffin play premium members launch near future also planning ways earn dragon scales without purchase bad every output worth dragon scale many dragon scales going pay refill stamina meter scales premium users outputs hours one time per month tried looking much scales would cost announcement found nothing considering bringing mechanic everyone must give much information possible comment removed comment need something players play every weeks fine paying per month even use hours making complete comment would never understand accept anything pay subscription matter big small restriction stamina system free play type system something usually full version subscription something put top issue sometimes going like retries like actions lost one comment dragon issue maybe system griffin completely least subscription comment justify bringing mechanic without decide say dragon expensive use maybe put ads dungeon website amp microtransactions mind problem developers announcing stamina mechanic information many scales cost premium users get scales month per subscription benefits stamina bar cost scales stamina bar limits actions per hours site announcement two options energy bar wait minutes recharge purchase energy dragon scales continue playing energy bar fully recharge every hours need wait full playing soon enough energy next output purchase energy dragon scales view detailed information energy click energy bar dungeon platform understand shift energy may difficult active users affected especially sensitive impact change premium users help ease transition premium users receive dragon scales time membership renews working add benefits like unlimited griffin play premium members launch near future also planning ways earn dragon scales without

subscription people basically means sorry afford pay tokens severely limited play half hour forty five minutes every eight hours know result suffer ads gladly long bigger seconds get energy recharge ratio least second energy ratio better pay play anyone either afford microtransactions people get without game possibly never return premium players certainly happy bucks month microtransactions playtime sustainable business model comment okay else would problem server cost comment griffin unlimited subscription moment update stamina bar comment see guess comment problem right energy bar probably gonna many players away matter tweak comment seems big backlash energy system presented exactly like mobile bullshit people hate past complete currency stupid names matter actual reasoning behind players profit simply actions left nothing believe would much even comment first think let know appreciate work done far big imo consumer one worst solution could give introducing monetization gacha mechanics already paying monthly sub wrong like without playerbase poll give issues money gave far also planning cost definitely something consumer comment would fine dragon even banner ads comment deleted comment makes sense stamina temporary thing figure way make money energy comment deleted comment comment shit people giving money rather price increase gladly pay dollars month rather shit also maybe players using lot resources maybe try get discuss issue implement caps really players could option well comment prefer latter energy system pretty see ads working know place comment deleted comment unsubscribed service based negative news twice time number two reading energy announcement today ultimately understanding along thinking fair enough gotta gotta got end premium users affected believe pay bucks month way insignificant days every service wants even system premium users exempt subscription canceled hope guys come slightly increasing premium costs pay another soon might pay couple bucks comment yeah unsubbed almost never done service even paying subscribers affected enough away however return moment exempt comment devs kill game since choose implement turn gets certain reaction playerbase turn game faster find good option earn enough money comment play dungeon come back every couple weeks get session leave entire month next time comment agree currently better system ads pay enough subscription cover price way people feel like worth else try limit much power users use system bare mind premium user probably one power users since say often hit retry million times trying get answer game would energy system top subscription one different game making money costing money keeps costing money eventually comment would fine stamina bar tweak energy consumed actions redos characters action consumed output comment kill game try figure way makes everything happy actions weekly comment unsubscribed try stay away games stamina microtransactions never thought see implemented pay higher monthly rate deal system comment already suggested two cents stamina bar dragon model since really model way free users scales dragon model outputs higher tier subscription unlimited higher stamina bar things used together stamina bar idea comment know could answer would free open source community project business selling product get small dev team planned project selling users experience sorry incentive continue using app sucks great comment sounds like faster could comment absolutely hope aidungeon around eventually reduce server costs enough comment pretty sure want energy system adjusted want comment know play game make get hundreds even people server costs cheaper traffic high comment server comment fucking first place comment good servers expensive many people use generated words cost cent imagine many words per day think monthly cost dragon model comment first solution thought lot came best way best way know fuck people getting angry like someone comment mind banner bottom keep micro transactions comment already know said still wrong reaction playerbase doesnt whats best game long run players always care whats good comment problem stamina system simple system annoying doesnt get like get money based people wanting wait comment remove idea bad literally planning minutes new system makes game feel like far less freedom already charge premium membership use version actually want make pay one posts game creativity freedom one wants really seems like money add maybe backgrounds things nature energy based pay play system everyone fun enjoyment game comment axe expensive system comment make sense seems like good way paying customers getting paid comment fine paying month dungeon subscription subscription charge much well price even point nature energy based system comment could ruin game stamina system comment undo redo free actually use resources believe actions undo actions though comment give better solution alternative easy say avoid stamina system devs open suggestions stamina system test comment people much ads pay ads would cover cost way could cover cost comment open suggestions almost certain seen forty reading system community much absolutely hate new system last still thing rather ahead remove like community say work coming days see adjust energy system asking asking removed basically give instead listening try force bit top added scales limit one fun buy pre made worlds alone sounds like thing add say backgrounds amp pre made stories bought scales even bought maybe features like generated characters least assuming really generated best ideas far better thinking game stamina restriction say comment okay know lots traffic servers means lots cost comment given think going help understand better leave someone else already suggested things make sense would bought would game stamina system way comment means people paying paying less cost comment know much cost much traffic mean argument could well stamina bar google reddit comment might convince people buy premium ads might convince people away use server resources comment know showing ads paying users worst worlds going people showing ads free users okay though developer said bring enough money comment said ads bring enough money comment still comes imo subscribe get features subscribe get features anything pay money full access developers game money like microtransactions comment option microtransactions costs high worth servers microtransactions users like comment bad design nobody going know many replies per minute want comment need even discuss probably less servers players playing comment scales useless use per month scale bullshit click bar times per day good reason either way still fucking premium users comment simply running less servers say dragon huge cost okay number servers running dragon every action twice long let people decide whether want fast griffon slow dragon comment mean people come would phrasing reply every seconds better mean people know playing get imagine plenty people would start playing free account would already idea make easy upgrade higher tier moment people could start guess upgrade find slow comment running servers gpt available openai seem way lower cost process slower openai remember less kind whole point dragon get idea staff marketing experience since could lot better dragon simply viable openai top tier subscription charges roughly cents per action cents per tokens action using tokens latitude likely better openai cost even something like cent per actions dragon money edit reading messages whether dragon using tokens comment least kind stamina people play often comment would subscribers looking like might drop dragon comment nobody many replies per seconds want either comment already canceled subscription seeing absolutely staff response discord hope future justify month severely form paying staff got paid first place comment would people would able get good idea playing free account little low tier first latitude makes easy tiers would matter taking long higher tier comment well losing subscribers right looks messages around subscribers costing bring since dragon seems issue drop dragon make energy system free users non energy griffin subscribers would probably better solution comment yes whole project dragon might even able cut back stamina situation need focus comment paying user understand difference dragon makes one thing since update seem completely willing said power users similar dropped cut way back site app game whatever useful feature away people used remember used able subscriptions instance people use site ones going suffer new system comment think energy would weekly cap instead hour hour system requires lot small plays would prefer longer plays comment definitely something thinking change share future comment easy decision guys fully understand stay trying times comment unsubbed hour ago care reasoning sorry may make enough money support product already charges monthly fee subscription ontop stamina system usually found mobile games cost add comment deleted stamina system even dragon right dragon hoping get get going one users upwards tokens right nothing costs thing know dragon team almost feel like needs die dungeon hate stamina system simply understand costs pay fact also server power even though bar yet hoping able get sustainable even comment lot people might disagree know game expensive run popularity etc one dragon subscriber model long time really energy system pay feel limited something already paying subscription know want keep lot people really think griffin system dragon sub based system play would best solution want pay price popularity game yeah game might free alternative griffin system long time subscribers pay comment gonna best sound like nuclear option maybe option comment dungeon charged per users pay monthly fee comment griffin sure exactly paying people want unlimited playtime comment comparing small development team million see problem comment already said cover cost discord comment gonna lie major content energy limit using actions testing using play game personally choose latter paying premium content game without getting anything even able play comment yeah high costs hard definitely unlimited griffin though still able testing want comment maybe say something comment since basically said thing yeah saying might ultimately give dragon drop even means losing subscribers trying hold onto around since dragon kinda feeling dragon going work amp yes losing subscribers possibly want support stamina system basically makes game useless difference losing subscribers losing subscribers bad one worse comment see statistics far every negative comment towards stamina system read cancelling subs course people accept cancel read quite possibly looks losing subs would drop dragon subs stamina system saying without statistics know options losing losing subscribers comment dragon expensive needs axe rather functioning griffon hundreds microtransactions dungeon comment dropped dragon would keep stamina system dragon reason needed without dragon needed anymore without dragon would really reason subscribe dragon people might hold even many drop yes statistics nobody say sure comment comment premium users still free unlimited griffin lots people would really see dragon completely comment one people comes rather see dragon see whole project die though ever axe dragon hope release source code like version griffin comment deleted comment would still premium features dragon could reduce price focus features something keep incentive comment opinion worth paying sure else could add would worth paying possible could maybe come something however decide hope find someone better current stamina system though comment look know expensive run know may stupid idea opinion axe half servers take bit longer process actions better yet servers fast slower servers premium users would get faster responses assuming faster servers expensive free players get slower would also help premium well comment theory price might able come quite extra stuff increasing subscribers time tell know subscribers fast stamina might quite hit time tell comment huge guys need dealing changes may impact experience users hurts paying users things may controversial might good idea get feel community feels idea announcing going know right guys issues long would probably marketing people help big changes implemented considering bare code well presented customers sometimes things like names phrasing etc may change people feel something even still get end result would probably also help also engage community regular users get users feel things try big changes see impact enjoyment service comment hey nick bit late thought share thoughts current situation made clear dragon financially viable least current state think anyone reaction dead see however see guys already stamina system completely server issues gpt acting much see anyone actually paying scales inputs recharge eight hours pre planned long scenario know likely guess fair already bleeding subscribers average player community going see stamina bar say know actual costs behind change knew simply dropping playerbase bad idea also think would dropping subscription viable solution found course going leave without suggestions tier system drop option add multiple would people pay month dragon though start extra playtime still viable let people run earn dragon scales controversial opinion maybe would problem something like scales playing ontop solutions afford keep aidungeon going subs alone time ask money way microtransactions cap actually fair users developers along something like patreon looks lot less bad limited actions nobody wants axe dragon imo would kill entire project something else done though comment griffin free use cause still even though dragon bigger still sucks money could use argument use stamina system might least people sub completely comment would want comment fucking comment nuclear option dragon problem needs comment ads could never work content away comment let put way generation dragon costs something say generation costs usd though closer usd seem like lot pay use actions month costing money use actions day day year come costs comment thankyou view handling hope find way premium benefits today looking posts find someone dragon subscriptions enough even pay dragon upkeep certainly want company comment play griffin bad actually know use comment well obsolete cause subscription tiers comment understand could wrong believe griffon costs much much lower dragon comment yeah hoping find better system better way handling stamina comment well increase actions seems nice added tiered system subscribing much better see recharge rate comment gotten test yet sounds good got per devs quick take care issues comment still think initial would lost premium users coming back comment absolutely think people team big things like might useful get comment honestly even money nick okay time probably keep make kinds decisions could take something comment released new announcement reddit quite well comment also allow ads make premium ads also add option much want pay subscription willing pay keep game sure others edit first comment could would pay subscription play lot game money currency makes comes game stuff comment mind ads going help least bit comment well hope dragon griffin retrained since would reduce comment much prefer ads understand business guess life comment open comment company expensive servers need money grow works also read old news month give unlimited griffin comment banners along sides space course want full break middle scenario banners sides use space bring money especially high traffic able get many people wanting buy space really could sell free version price normal game well amp thoughts comment open run servers understanding made model used non profit profit charged dungeon use model comment traffic higher cost really think possible run servers money also came late comment feature already comment really think temporary comment well solution pay get unlimited access griffin reply month old comment know need money run server right come free comment reddit end comment comparing way low costs per user tons ads dungion comment agree likely dungion bankrupt completely users server costs comment like two months ago someone said energy bar bigger since people play week comment got dollars month comment deleted comment dragon would put like two ago something comment losing subscriptions good subscriptions closer going bankrupt comment servers read messages pay attention comment paying users good popularity platform people would cost money might trying get people leave point considering platform many comment looks like everyone wants kill dragon free comment toxic people cost platform money acting like dollars month important comment remove ads better make bar faster slow comment basically since play aid almost daily get play like hours new energy system since actions used even thinking subscribing one point system get shit playing game daily even long adventures anymore since system long get amp guess subscribe soon atleast removed comment make suggestion discord one point saying larger per week adjusted recharge rate idea would actually given users less actions month guess wanna take money people like make whole story one rather days comment money server time grow project would without comment mind ads honestly like bar bottom ruin game comment play daily comment push patreon let know want stupid energy system limits users subscribe patreon much generated patreon though since amount people amount money comment two months ago trying comment could give option watching increase energy could sell space like mobile apps comment like time make dungeon game desktop without stamina course still make dragon sub however little note think searching lot however making desktop game still good remove server costs things like comment still energy

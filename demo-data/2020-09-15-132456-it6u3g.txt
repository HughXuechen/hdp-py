everything learned guide remember world info etc edit post info bit outdated see wiki found aid really without user much technical information want know well guide guide meant dragon much experience using griffin first technical limitations may tokens work unless story written nothing single letter words aid far operates hard character comes first using lmi input actually sent aid bpe see words though context limit around characters less depending usually around bpe tokens aid try content memory combination remember world info call however space memory utilize used content instead thereby nothing written memory used content instead technically possible send tokens tokenize case likely gpt end instead way token gpt sees context want see check generally word token words break multiple tokens depending nature non words like numbers tokenize much differently aid operates far technical limit cohesiveness devs things get full token also story writing better input possibly even short dragon model used utilize full token anyway moving let talk wis key word aid look recent context include remember aid seems look context posts full active block context sees essentially key description injected top remember event remember text long aid prioritize including descriptions leads exist example context says gozi gozi description says kiki lives reference kiki key know however might decide mention kiki generic random way taking kiki mentions kiki look npc context bit without memory say john horse named bess using short words enough information character writing john bess mare tells bit horse role gender may enough mention horse name way makes sense would trigger bess details posts order back tokens stretch really consider way phrase sentence without sounding robotic also details consider whether probably based context important details get right tips descriptions include robotic mentioned use natural text use robotic sounding sentences style writing going narrative writing linebreaks probably harm good use without good reason consider fact description triggered prefixed remember prefixed context sent gpt bunch linebreaks might struggle group subject matter together well everything else write third person point descriptions come remember remember text often define even matter order aid could story change pov longer someone else third person descriptions avoid problems cases write information already remember assuming remember always talk numbers hard things like exact age exact time exact use use terms instead tall say tall use numbers like instead write morning common details good details example model association color usually define detail good reliable however pet bird beak color seemed impossible association beak color model important get detail right methods good tokens beak example mentioned fact different sentence finally got right beak red red beak red color beak word association ultimately trying probably good idea though thought share observation regardless aid tell details appearance much focus things keys maybe complex plural example make key king trigger writing king come key like kingdom would also trigger writing asking shorter keys may constantly trigger use memory good reason really need short key triggered within words like cat location could consider putting space side like cat however perfect nearby etc something consider though spaces keys work fine aid triggered wis description top thereby input see difference random scene written thereby consider descriptions scene instead called write people call although story lots world travel exact example may always accurate moving onto remember tips remember like written person useful things found write time example morning campsite long chat someone fact morning active context block may see campsite since people well going time helpful keep mind time though need update info example forest gozi gozi case world setting describe however description come context actually mentions key give order help keep genre write gozi short words like gozi medieval kingdom give general direction like want explore forest way anything happening narrative idea move things word objective also powerful narrative like objective reach top establish link name write bob form sentence people also write bob pov bottom though personally found necessary gpt technically see difference remember context comes could consider writing bottom story players chose write remember characters wis remember always part story characters may come actually write details topic theory model natural language works best paragraph form descriptions would recommend try although things always black work theory around play something like human natural text paragraph form better model play something non human made template style may help understand word better example lizliz male name lizliz gender male traits horns long tall lean job equipment lives alone story ultimately test see style works best leads next topic test want test knowledge something ways first use story mode input style finish sentence example say fantasy called wizwots write something like read book everything know wizwots book let finish even everything never accurate time best hope accurate enough time story better lean less extremely specific details give general direction one trick found work well something like writing letter need describe look like write course try look trick simple methods though often times track description start story things instead letter method way keep attention also describe command though personal success using command left terribly want try would look like describe merchant age important spaces add last keeps command sees merchant context describe topics comma separate trying though use command sentence something seem right check lmi last model input aid actually compiling send gpt look lmi start new scenario stuff top create scenario copy paste wis time post work give least little prompt start scenario personal adventure remember prompt last block context assuming adventure scenario post characters although last actually matter input something second window back scenario open scripts next world info button top right corner lmi show input adventures based scenario see sent random tips maybe topics something exist world tell brings subject attention due random nature may decide include way instead focus exist instead words trick old information griffin harm good dragon trick list bunch medieval words try genre narrative example made words always break multiple tokens things use made word would recommend bit shorter side however comes made words short also cause problems find character never say name consider another find suddenly person like second check context may made way regardless retry alter even though remember wis around characters less helps give wis may come based story progresses best keep things lean optimized people single word negatives better multi word negatives impossible possible example define npc etc need way get never mention mention work fine want surprise need find way horse example bess one method going writing big paragraph something necessary wrong terribly interesting either could consider back way context block used stuff consider author note injected context back new paragraph move next one exists context found useful remember speaking content may link remember data context example write end scene move onto next story may remember information thinking part another scene wis triggered last posts context keep mind short posts unless want intentionally clear memory irrelevant wis instead exact struggle color description add end like etc end note fact need line time first line last line think got something terribly wrong share see updating guide due complex nature aid possible something wrong recommend back corrections comment thanks stuff much started playing memory really helpful tips grey kyros sure would one question since remember way recommend one person one person really matter help keep dynamic difference mind comment sure matter one theory aid allows change pov switch characters whether thing happening make longer could talking updating guide bit thanks comment remember world info call descriptions essentially dynamic form remember know uses tokens see access kind information comment whole token input thing feature gpt aid way try make useful info found going aid discord search sure tokens spent new author note feature comment sorry trying kind feel like quite question really asking specifically conclusion tokens used remember world info specifically lead conclusion works way creators say discord comment really really great info thank much compiling everyone testing also trying make sure info accurate possible details even considered thanks things possibly corroborate trick get bird beak example something kissing booth scenario gendered either male hosts female hosts really important get right world info entry describing kissing booth workers essentially used synonyms reinforce gender hosts female volunteers kissing booth etc right detail different ways get stick worked gender synonyms otherwise normal entry gender inclusive option simply avoid using gendered language like said best even saying gender work kissing booth least sort way human beings also suggesting human beings say thus took harm approach said thought necessary establish setting plot device theory players fill left open via prompt memory world info free onto player idea gender whatever may run within limitations model learned course fact big reason believe scenario works well least experience play dragon set length set less approach suggested two world info entries describe important details setting may otherwise good reference kissing booth workers behave scenario also use prompt guide players creating short concise one phrase character description hopefully packed information descriptive way telling important character story character description output first paragraph exactly four sentences five playing gendered hosts option name hopefully info packed concise character description setting story main plot device kissing booth also triggers world info entry describing entry mentions second world info entry enough detail get bess mare example observation mentioning gender booth hosts reinforce one detail suggested player copy paste engineered paragraph memory hopefully enough keep track play concise prompt four five sentence memory two optimized tried least world info entries thus really said makes scenario work well makes inclusive everyone plus lots context tokens left players make adventure story progresses sorry talk engineered scenario much wanted share experience help corroborate said memory world info much could fact knowledge subject see scenario could improved would great guide creating better never comment thinking author note feature inserts three inputs back believe shares part tokens input output found new feature allows see last inputs adventure see author note text right memory triggered world info entries etc comment creators say discord chat role yes though also mentioned quite times chat general suggesting exactly anything post meant information get good wiki right wrong aid intentionally tokens used point post corrections update old info either outdated wrong comment posts back time type author note something would need keep updating comment makes author note different tools inserts three inputs back long active way moves along story copy paste example comment good enough know well wanted make sure reliable noticed lot people making works wanted sure comment pretty interesting might test longer story generated entries really mind details wrong anything important fixed alter long keeps setting bit make change something exist part something user want exist world people think mean things exist real like comment glad test made author note different position thought maybe maybe know three inputs inputs see moves story progresses update third paragraph back including input author note insertion first input prompt output name shy teen girl never currently outside carnival carnival kissing booth never seen kissing booth little know kissing booth people even stranger make kiss idea seems rather decide check later good cause author note coming age story written sweet romantic style thinking kissing booth one volunteers give free single kiss choose whether person closely second output input prompt player first input teen rather tall age around old although hard tell since face see teeth perfect author note coming age story written sweet romantic style let alone kiss find like shy kiss stranger third output input embarrassed face surprise get instead says big job author note coming age story written sweet romantic style little give feel taking away approach people output input back feel reach side stop away gives side expect come back author note coming age story written sweet romantic style embarrassed show would player input comment thanks added note bottom comment clear author note continue take tokens position moving next position story exists one insertion third paragraph including recent input might incorrect observation though take grain salt comment generated entries like personally kept generated entries made sense using keys common words would cause constantly trigger comment speaking common words one thing used wonder used fill use generic keyword like guard different guard entries randomly read one entries memory guard bring brings choose ones narrative randomly chose one based context example desert two entries guard keyword mentioning desert prioritize entries unlike generated entries never used common words like wolf king etc used specific ones like people names specific terms like pet wolf king made less likely information would brought narrative generated info seems come lot often almost never far generated stuff usually fill entries details like important fact city character remembering info happen often better remembering imo mention brother named fenton mage rather remember friend named fenton mage remember fenton plus entry fixed really important also improved lot since came better important details get many write entries entries irrelevant though entries add adventure two fighting monsters common bring myconids people well stuck everything prompt archer archer water mage water myconids never suddenly changed monsters like entries incorrect like mentioning one myconids friend even though wanted stop fighting really affect cohesiveness narrative way open window probably fill everything least much always open click edit adventure click world info button click add world info type entry click back every time want add new detail remember comment author note work specific telling make text descriptive get give slapstick comedy film noir comment guards would brought would information context said could throwing data related scene like might think could related example aid gives king common word way said king also knows kingdom based context remember two king wis one kingdom would correct king mention keys plural forms well key matter comment great description thanks comment guards world info entries key would one entry key various descriptions together helpful event run room entries length limit want add details word already knows otherwise token limit comment like best use generic keys like guard use names unique traits keys maybe specific job like guard whatever comment use context sure surprise npc world info currently also currently context yes use specific keys want entries treated separate comment author note seems powerful correct shares tokens input output powerful input type unlike input however story much longer story case point testing new working mousai scripts pack around time update came players author note necessary test method would time entry author note one via scripts different using method everything happening scene real actually everything happening scene real actually movie set sure enough within one two actions character noticed corner room important thing note nothing else scenario everything actually movie set meant left yet powerful enough still stuck almost immediately get slapstick film noir stick would reinforcing color using tools would help prompt text memory world info entries etc film set pretty seemed two tells still helps reinforce via various means also maybe try reinforcing different ways example try characters three world info writing prompt saying author note story slapstick comedy anything happen know understand pretty well throwing example case helps comment glad could help everything scenario open world info entries etc saying everything perfect means want see everything described works together two world info entries gender inclusive option two male hosts female hosts option see gendered hosts simply throwing bunch synonyms otherwise normal entry comment know exactly multi word keys used specifically work like tags searching explore treated differently example tags work like starship enterprise hits starship enterprise starship enterprise hit starship thus works tags works whole words however case would also mean monster girl would register hit words monster girl strange character delimited keyword entry system clear time mean say strange search system key system would expect world info comment far tell simple full match key called stormfall meadows started reading exactly stormfall meadows would accurate information combination even need end comment thanks world info entries making context triggers world info entries sounds powerful could used make things trigger things add stuck long paragraph switch story mode send quotes stop paragraph trigger dialogue something interesting happen also use alter add end last thing sent long paragraph dialogue said character know stop talking continue story comment expect bring manually like fill certain characters show whether inputs makes behave certain way associates certain traits works really powerful experience nothing since use unique keys affect memory much used generic terms might well fill hope best also makes less likely characters like kyros grey show alter even better always change course story already certain traits associates names think going spend next playing around without automatic updates many keys manually since update going fill anything even interesting story like use keys unique least keys many different entries example probably use since probably two three like test bunch adventures around actions see much better use automatic updates better edit testing remember world info seem working better general ago one adventures bard going tell story something called beast karkout brought name took define beast world info started story described large black beast bull sharp claws used keys beast karkout beast karkout karkout bard described black creature sharp teeth long horns karkout searching large found forest lines later beast also uses horns use claws extremely sharp able pretty used info gave changed like describing bull like traits instead specifically mentioning word bull added details also creature story bit later exactly work right never much success even need hit retry get right definitely working well generated entries incorrect info going memory hope devs make access world info comment sure long ago changed keywords match substrings spaces also lead discord example use stormfall meadow key trigger stormfall meadows stormfall meadow key even used key trigger side short keys like cat trigger things related key cat keyword trigger words like catastrophe location etc avoid short keywords need spaces cat instead cat comment useful know thanks bit testing update info comment used keys beast karkout beast karkout karkout guide information check near bottom tips list could get away using karkout key comment almost use story mode means start every sentence surprised words raise eyebrows give questioning look instead raise eyebrows surprised words give questioning look describing actions natural yes using quotes prompt switch narrative back pretty comment key cat context catastrophe trigger comment add key trigger take away catastrophe context would trigger key cat cat context would trigger key catastrophe comment thanks much information sounds like trying take care keys plural forms context help feel tokens even problem quite cases example common fantasy genre still going need two tags elf elf dwarf dwarf mention common words similarly complex plural forms like leaf leaf leaves supply supply supplies imo need use back full match plural forms mentioned could fact taken care match substrings context instead extremely player trying create world info entry saying longer comma delimited system one would better results simply keywords together commas spaces would take care cat problem without two characters spaces hit catastrophe hit pet cat intended edit think backwards case spaces along commas necessary get results said one question happen know underscore key treated designed keys mousai scripts pack using underscore try normal context hits however characters like space explore keyword like mousai register false context simply mentions events definitely intended update actually think even treated space key designed guard false thanks comment seems backwards comment mobile let use comment tried mobile tried writing without move back add last comment use character pov character character name first person send something like surprised words raise eyebrows give questioning look natural seen anything like get first person seems lot less story comment tried using person used reading things far stretch comment tried leaves text comment say observations even griffin model recently taken care remember world info surprised even multiple still remembers travelling travelling going fact zombie scenario characters using template gave best even normal world info character interesting observations using bob dylan brother generally check often break main character even world info bob player character bob worked well also world entries remember define example bob travelling dylan far tell dead character immediately world info non lines age appearance etc add line dead joe killed zombies recently joe dead similarly line remember specifically tell group general context story zombie outbreak world info entries zombie outbreak city etc remember need single line triggers keys current objective find somewhere safe zombie outbreak means travel added world info using three keys horse travel use sentences say character group travelling horse finally lot success using template remember current location current objective travelling entries job usually long location scene would context however lines able create characters hotel supplies spend night chat bit morning actually remembers spent night hotel zombies outside travelling horse dylan stacy going reach canada pretty bob travelling dylan stacy supplies low low water low bullets equipment bullets current location hotel near city many zombies nearby many nearby current objective find somewhere safe zombie outbreak reach canada recent events joe killed zombies bob dylan stacy joe comment wonder use terms comment using generic words triggers important noticed adventures limit triggers entry dumbledore instead dumbledore leads focus entry come sure entries triggered time far would considered part context kept enough also really good remember worked pretty well comment thank putting sort detail wiki find yet comment could think wiki least closely thereby think supply type information whatever reason anyway guide old things changed since take grain salt

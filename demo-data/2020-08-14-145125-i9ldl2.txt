questions really game far questions remember feature work write things like name still forgets minutes later supposed write enough writing helicopter makes remember helicopter also sometimes forgets something seconds example found gun seconds later someone keep story track one second next thing know girl characters behind game sometimes completely forgets someone behind usually make story mode sometimes work weird stuff complicated make actions usually use actions like enter building game keeps creative creative write actions actually work thanks comment second new well comment use instead remember instead name john name john remember also formatted sort bullet point like way sentence different important detail name john knight could also use remember keep characters travelling joe keep story specific time period could use remember something like live age whatever know well would work mostly either use retry edit remove things take time period like maybe changing gun bow fantasy setting even removing sentence altogether make actions long short want actually reccomend using story instead sometimes ignore actions use remember using story actions need format like open door make sure add period want action end got anything wrong edit forgot another way keep people dissapearing make sure long without mentioned game comment thing keep mind dungeon next word sentence certain number input know writing story characters amp nbsp limited amount input look generate output become easy prompt remember field last number lines lost track many lines last think means sometimes remind things use edit correct entire line things written remember field get less important something story output wrong happens amp nbsp learn little point right direction example long tends using characters names instead said conversation long enough names get input occasionally force characters names lines even sounds bit amp nbsp another example delete input line input information command want sounds really place back delete reply example new character want force give description sometimes input write would describe person someone else want delete input comment use instead remember instead name john name john remember also formatted sort bullet point like way sentence different important detail name john knight could also use remember keep characters travelling joe try next time see works better keep story specific time period could use remember something like live age whatever know well would work mostly either use retry edit remove things take time period like maybe changing gun bow fantasy setting even removing sentence altogether use alter edit function much retry times get reply makes sense try make actions long short want actually reccomend using story instead sometimes ignore actions use remember using story actions need format like open door make sure add period want action end noticed sometimes completely action retrying usually works try use story instead thanks comment limit know game lot learn thanks comment make use alter retry keep story track accept keep retrying good get something good retry like times make answer best retries got nothing change prompt slightly comment fairly new thing still help bit sure exactly way write things remember feature like knight warchief gigachad warchief gigachad sometimes works still somewhat wonky may still forget written things weird result wrote arthur later arthur understand get right still much story result alter back try something else else use story force certain direction characters remember feature add supposed using generally keep two actions turn say got anything complicated use story also feature called world info edit certain well work comment world info basically way fed information certain shows example story character called garrett master thief garrett master thief write garrett master thief information either garrett master thief shows inputs information well works remember means works occasionally comment remember work occasionally works great though remember make retry even useful already though sometimes retry times remembers relevant information fed remember remember useful use help keep story track like anything actually much late could using lot retry also found nsfw mode makes likely setting change one since nsfw mode makes every person like joe character one thing noticed done remember characters characters enter story characters forget retry sometimes work especially fed information characters remembers back though inputs found understand fairly complex inputs like take sometimes may retry two get right though use story make sure type exactly type also used actions make cast fairly complex ridiculous spells fun see come way describe comment edit forgot another way keep people dissapearing make sure long without mentioned game important tends forget details time especially new information good idea think every sentence enter point make generate story reference something relevant less less likely use story comment think mostly true model model seems better remembering details long comment short answer remember work supposed add things second person person characters way try putting another character name like putting evelyn without quotes game story mode evelyn without quotes game perspective continue first person clear evelyn forgets keep using evelyn happens people keep story track actions means track want story need make use reload function game something else shows something back track edit character names wrong shows would make back track sometimes makes sense instead sister sent instead never edit continue game allow characters say character mentions around allow may become mentions anything want part story reload like allow someone say word story become force eventually one easy turn story type name nothing else hit enter game acknowledge tell say sometimes way get someone need game make impossible get way use name like could make game though game may make different character name clear tell know know tell world find character tells game character make stuff world look create world use character tell world take look said create world way tell written means complicated want least complicated forget command use say story mode continue people might told game story take building story write story work know wrote wrote true command want decided way want generate never allow get solution find dungeon may impossible way example really like girl want girlfriend game decided want girlfriend nothing command make accept try try may even might say spend much time continue girlfriend solution use say command tell decided accept offer accept girlfriend game take look acknowledge offer since offer become girlfriend single line powerful command could sent story mode like use want world getting hard comment useful controlling pov story pov generally things character perspective let control character actions wonky sometimes forgets exactly controlling though like else might take get remember comment best give write story mode write good want write continue point seems read mind type enter read continued want use character name take control one characters like show prompts good really sometimes like show prompt show prompt want give comment actions story keeps putting character called david david got bury keeps alive characters remember show dead still alive comment remembers last prompts comment hit actions zombie word amount retries need insane sometimes spend minutes retrying single prompt really write entire story amount times roommate insane also roommate got revealed around entries makes sense since story taken place maybe live without comment zombie world taken character little david hard another one see david actually write actually alive make putting wrote remember every time david character remind david dead let comment also used actions make cast fairly complex ridiculous spells fun see come way describe cast tells done successfully still hit output comment kinda sounds like remember function without character limit comment sometimes basically late one long conversation girl first times told first time another girl later story girl even later revealed part story continued late lost sister comment means stuff like retry used spells successfully many times comment somewhat least number entries description limited characters thing really powerful allows characters spells work times far really work comment bury let comment want great using story mode instead already getting much better allows story correct way still remembering slightly better kinda know remember works remind comment might work better remember long name fed something reference make use name eventually forget enough without comment good idea

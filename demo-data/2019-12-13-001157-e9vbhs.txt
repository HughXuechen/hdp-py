hey need input question would kickstarter money make improved better version game kind tiers would comment think patreon would better already getting good amount support like idea tier getting input different comment kinda feel like one kickstarter patreon comment trying find even ways make money would love see improvements roadmap app qol improvements plenty question considering plenty give qol options already would find best focus later could imagine tech sub really want see app version comment try avoid low effort need also seen questions community might able make cohesive without requirements like system maintain continuity know enough tech know feasible comment deleted comment feasible one first results gpt exactly would aidungeon would also nice low make stories cohesive better made possible first gpt plenty ways improve comment kickstarter bad get lump sum community patreon kinda patrons roadmap patrons also feel product want comment hey building alexa game play possible version model run find dont want alexa say comment influx better enough reasons want large lump sum lot time think good idea want patreon make would link payments updates possible would even better link roadmap patreon two updates month one updates got smaller smaller yet patreon tiers could patreon monthly based number updates content put comment charge people play version model already pretty support comment seems bad idea constantly learning people use work comment maybe free version pro version pro version could currently music graphics maybe system pro version players access comment right game people already really needs marketing anything say going lump sum sounds good trying get sure possible hold part though would version first comment ahh thanks comment kinda lot comment think kickstarter way forward chat despite one great enough point amount continuity still system issue regular chat awesome still level needs something would back personally would know product continuity far probably possible time issue think kickstarter possible comment way people need know aidungeon even kickstarter comment music graphics likely bit far content game think currently open game would community could charge payments app game especially locally good community around love game possibilities people would like think like many people getting tired eventually sure many maybe regarding current continuity pay improvements might enough get longer term yet think community model open access maintain traction roadmap time comment people comment thanks input sounds like kickstarter use patreon give community roadmap plan improve going roadmap current plan bit get comment thanks think kind comment good point makes sense comment good point giving roadmap say app version really important way google keep subsidizing massive gpu costs long app version able per gpu also colab number reasons crashes accessible blind people really sad since game able level money please keep mind money made dungeon point still need pay back months patreon get get roadmap soon comment ton ways like improve dungeon got ton ideas first though make playable colab dungeon soon way keep subsidizing massive costs comment good point thanks input comment feel going route comment good work plan try give updates comment building version dungeon definitely long term open research questions comment thanks input issue see going forward google colab likely access dungeon soon per month current focus make game one people play comment help know play pretty local gpu older older play working mind longer get lot less saying maybe local version thinking gpu requirements comment well would probably best patreon although stupid idea although large plan time youtubers smaller youtubers people idea reach ask help ask show game like ask give patreon sure would people would willing new found people game community people playing likely although part could thinking game stupid plan want take think plan quite say willing help best time nick comment thanks maybe good model look dwarf fortress comment think tier patreon would large influx new patrons many people would willing pay support pay less comment think locally playable version put cost also subscription based app version would good personally purely subscription based probably pay use made one super hold yet monthly payment life definitely dish bucks local version though less crashes improved put one time payment credits towards cloud compute might even dish occasionally results comment want version know run standard comment dwarf fortress imagine possibilities two way comment would prefer credit arcade model cover compute subscription model thought people would prefer subscription open different ideas comment never thought right would game blind people comment yep people reach saying really sad colab version accessible comment nick need marketing great needs people already could take look way great idea get traction support comment personally yeah though small seems like something play occasionally show friend house months like hey awesome thing purely subscription model effort show friend house say credit could either save use months later avoid like ahh gotta sub month play small gotta keep playing make worthwhile think could definitely though makes sense playing ideas might use enough make subscription make sense players might prefer model sub model credits best still play even run use keep kinda like work giving keep sub comment deleted comment great playing locally even cpu playable times using quite enough though comment still back gpt new google people use super gpus free still people want use gpus cloud based servers dungeon thing make gpu love dungeon much though around gpt something make stories using even though month still see aid hopefully long life gotta first comment exactly colab makes sense free resource research free resource games give gpus would free comment never really anything think way less pay version standard take time run comment good know see set something like app version working comment cost cloud servers good route want make work well mobile comment seen game especially regarding kickstarter towards dont want support comment sure kickstarter mobile version willing pay comment arcade system would people time think kind system would possibly customer level customer might sounds especially one customers important keep customers back play keep regular subscription credit based system might people get tired spending money play games possibly eventually get playing subscription system customers payment way play game makes feel less like spending money play game amount times despite subscription system options nice either could work important make sure considering cover costs long term plan please although customers business building business super important already way seems comment though model already see way updates save able run without seems show constantly comment thanks input great thought comment soon comment yeah would mind bucks game want monthly subscription give money comment question make sense much tpus seems like worthwhile especially already working gpt comment kinda makes sense since gpu cpu issue would getting model comment please constantly learning gpt comment yep would need set got cloud tpus hopefully able help comment found gpus time comment still comment deleted comment money one time would definitely find way comment good comment dwarf fortress building good aid community

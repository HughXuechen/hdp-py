    "This model is able to non-parametrically cluster each group's data while sharing information both between and within groups.  A Dirichlet process is essentially a discrete distribution with atoms drawn from a (not-necessarily discrete) base measure $H$ and gradually decreasing weights determined by the \"stick-breaking process.\"  In the HDP, each group is a Dirichlet process drawn from another DP $G_0$, so these will contain the same atoms as $G_0$ but with different weights:\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "G_0 &= \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\beta_k \\delta(\\phi_k) \\\\\n",
    "G_j &= \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\pi_{jk} \\delta(\\phi_k) \\\\\n",
    "\\phi_k | H &\\sim H\n",
    "\\end{aligned} $$\n",
    "Additionally, if we define $\\beta, \\pi_j$ as the collected weights above, it can be shown that these vectors encode a distribution over $\\mathbb{Z}^+$ such that $\\beta | \\gamma \\sim GEM(\\gamma)$ and $\\pi_j | \\alpha_0, \\beta \\sim DP(\\alpha_0, \\beta)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Successive draws from a DP exhibit clustering behavior, since the probability of taking a certain value is a related to the number of previous draws of that value.  This is shown in the hierarchical sense by the *Chinese restaurant franchise* process.  Imagine a group of Chinese restaurants with a certain number of tables at each restaurant.  Let $\\phi_k$ be the global dishes, drawn from $H$; $\\psi_{jt}$ be the table-specific dishes, drawn from $G_0$; and $\\theta_{ji}$ be the customer-specific dishes, drawn from $G_j$.  Denote $t_{ji}$ as the table index where customer $ji$ sits; $k_{jt}$ be the dish index served at table $jt$; $n_{jtk}$ be the customer counts; and $m_{jk}$ be the table counts.  Then:\n",
